<p><strong>About the Object Management Group</strong></p>
<p>Founded in 1989, the Object Management Group, Inc. (OMG) is an open
membership, not-for-profit computer industry standards consortium that
produces and maintains computer industry specifications for
interoperable, portable and reusable enterprise applications in
distributed, heterogeneous environments. Membership includes Information
Technology vendors, end users, government agencies and academia.</p>

following a mature, open process. OMG's specifications implement the
Model Driven Architecture® (MDA®), maximizing ROI through a
full-lifecycle approach to enterprise integration that covers multiple
operating systems, programming languages, middleware and networking
infrastructures, and software development environments. OMG's
specifications include: UML® (Unified Modeling Language™); CORBA®
(Common Object Request Broker Architecture); CWM™ (Common Warehouse
Meta-model); and industry-specific standards for dozens of vertical
markets.</p>

<p><strong>Issues</strong></p>

issues/problems with this specification to:
<a href="https://www.omg.org/report_issue.htm">https://www.omg.org/report_issue.htm</a></p>
<h1>Scope</h1>
<p>The primary goal of <strong>DMN</strong> is to provide a common notation that is
readily understandable by all business users, from the business analysts
needing to create initial decision requirements and then more detailed
decision models, to the technical developers responsible for automating
the decisions in processes, and finally, to the businesspeople who will
manage and monitor those decisions. <strong>DMN</strong> creates a standardized
bridge for the gap between the business decision design and decision
implementation. <strong>DMN</strong> notation is designed to be usable alongside the
standard <strong>BPMN</strong> business process notation.</p>
<p>Another goal is to ensure that decision models are interchangeable
across organizations via an XML representation.</p>
<p>The authors have brought forth expertise and experience from the
existing decision modeling community and have sought to consolidate the
common ideas from these divergent notations into a single standard
notation.</p>
<h1>Conformance</h1>
<h2>Conformance levels</h2>
<p>Software may claim compliance or conformance with <strong>DMN</strong> if and only if
the software fully matches the applicable compliance points as stated in
the specification. Software developed only partially matching the
applicable compliance points may claim that the software was based on
this specification but may not claim compliance or conformance with this
specification.</p>
<p>The specification defines three levels of conformance, namely
<strong>Conformance Level 1</strong>, <strong>Conformance Level 2</strong>, and <strong>Conformance
Level 3</strong>.</p>
<p>An implementation claiming conformance to Conformance Level 1 is not
required to support Conformance Level 2 or Conformance Level 3. An
implementation claiming conformance to Conformance Level 2 is not
required to support Conformance Level 3.</p>
<p>An implementation claiming conformance to <strong>Conformance Level 1</strong> SHALL
comply with all of the specifications set forth in clauses 6 (Decision
Requirements), 7 (Decision Logic) and 8 (Decision Table) of this
document. An implementation claiming conformance to Conformance Level 1
is never required to interpret expressions (modeled as an Expression
elements) in decision models. However, to the extent that an
implementation claiming conformance to Conformance Level 1 provides an
interpretation to an expression, that interpretation SHALL be consistent
with the semantics of expressions as specified in clause 7.</p>
<p>An implementation claiming conformance to <strong>Conformance Level 2</strong> SHALL
comply with all of the specifications set forth in clauses 6 (Decision
Requirements), 7 (Decision Logic) and 8 (Decision Table) of this
document. In addition, it is required to interpret expressions in the
simple expression language (S-FEEL) specified in clause 9.</p>
<p>An implementation claiming conformance to <strong>Conformance Level 3</strong> SHALL
comply with all of the specifications set forth in clauses 6 (Decision
Requirements), 7 (Decision Logic), 8 (Decision Table) and 10 (Expression
language) of this document. Notice that the simple expression language
that is specified in clause 9 is a subset of FEEL, and that, therefore,
an implementation claiming conformance to Conformance Level 3 can also
claim conformance to Conformance Level 2 (and to Conformance Level 1).</p>
<p>In addition, an implementation claiming conformance to any of the three
<strong>DMN</strong> conformance levels SHALL comply with all of the requirements set
forth in Clause 2.2.</p>
<h2>General conformance requirement</h2>
<h3>Visual appearance</h3>
<p>A key element of <strong>DMN</strong> is the choice of shapes and icons used for the
graphical elements identified in this specification. The intent is to
create a standard visual language that all decision modelers will
recognize and understand. An implementation that creates and displays
decision model diagrams SHALL use the graphical elements, shapes, and
markers illustrated in this specification.</p>
<p>There is flexibility in the size, color, line style, and text positions
of the defined graphical elements, except where otherwise specified.</p>
<p>The following extensions to a <strong>DMN</strong> Diagram are permitted:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>New markers or indicators MAY be added to the specified graphical
elements. These markers or indicators could be used to highlight a
specific attribute of a DMN element or to represent a new subtype of
the corresponding concept.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new shape representing a new kind of artifact MAY be added to a
Diagram, but the new shape SHALL NOT conflict with the shape
specified for any other DMN element or marker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Graphical elements MAY be colored, and the coloring may have
specified semantics that extend the information conveyed by the
element as specified in this standard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The line style of a graphical element MAY be changed, but that
change SHALL NOT conflict with any other line style required by this
specification.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Decision semantics</h3>
<p>This specification defines many semantic concepts used in defining
decisions and associates them with graphical elements, markers, and
connections.</p>
<p>To the extent that an implementation provides an interpretation of some
<strong>DMN</strong> diagram element as a semantic specification of the associated
concept, the interpretation SHALL be consistent with the semantic
interpretation herein specified.</p>
<h3>Attributes and model associations</h3>
<p>This specification defines a number of attributes and properties of the
semantic elements represented by the graphical elements, markers, and
connections. Some attributes are specified as mandatory but have no
representation or only optional representation. And some attributes are
specified as optional.</p>
<p>For every attribute or property that is specified as mandatory, a
conforming implementation SHALL provide some mechanism by which values
of that attribute or property can be created and displayed. This
mechanism SHALL permit the user to create or view these values for each
<strong>DMN</strong> element specified to have that attribute or property.</p>
<p>Where a graphical representation for that attribute or property is
specified as required, that graphical representation SHALL be used.
Where a graphical representation for that attribute or property is
specified as optional, the implementation MAY use either a graphical
representation or some other mechanism.</p>
<p>If a graphical representation is used, it SHALL be the representation
specified. Where no graphical representation for that attribute or
property is specified, the implementation MAY use either a graphical
representation or some other mechanism. If a graphical representation is
used, it SHALL NOT conflict with the specified graphical representation
of any other <strong>DMN</strong> element.</p>

<h1>Introduction to DMN</h1>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The purpose of <strong>DMN</strong> is to provide the constructs that are needed to
model decisions, so that organizational decision- making can be readily
depicted in diagrams, accurately defined by business analysts, and
(optionally) automated.</p>
<p>Decision-making is addressed from two different perspectives by existing
modeling standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Business process models (e.g., <strong>BPMN</strong>) can describe the
coordination of decision-making within business processes by
defining specific tasks or activities within which the
decision-making takes place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decision logic (e.g., PRR, PMML) can define the specific logic used
to make individual decisions, for example as business rules,
decision tables, or executable analytic models.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, a number of authors (including members of the submission team)
have observed that decision-making has an internal structure which is
not conveniently captured in either of these modeling perspectives. Our
intention is that <strong>DMN</strong> will provide a third perspective -- the
Decision Requirements Diagram -- forming a bridge between business
process models and decision logic models:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Business process models will define tasks within business processes
where decision-making is required to occur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decision Requirements Diagrams will define the decisions to be made
in those tasks, their interrelationships, and their requirements for
decision logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decision logic will define the required decisions in sufficient
detail to allow validation and/or automation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together, Decision Requirements Diagrams and decision logic can
provide a complete decision model which complements a business process
model by specifying in detail the decision-making carried out in process
tasks. The relationships between these three aspects of modeling are
shown in Figure 5-1.</p>
<p><img src="media/image2.jpg" alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;6.4847222222222225in&quot;
height=&quot;5.388194444444444in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 5-1: Aspects of modeling</strong></p>
<p>The resulting connected set of models will allow detailed modeling of
the role of business rules and analytic models in business processes,
cross-validation of models, top-down process design and automation, and
automatic execution of decision-making (e.g., by a business process
management system calling a decision service deployed from a business
rules management system).</p>
<p>Although Figure 5-1 shows a linkage between a business process model and
a decision model for the purposes of explaining the relationship between
<strong>DMN</strong> and other standards, it must be stressed that <strong>DMN</strong> is not
dependent on <strong>BPMN</strong>, and its two levels -- decision requirements and
decision logic -- may be used independently or in conjunction to model a
domain of decision-making without any reference to business processes
(see Figure 5-2).</p>
<p><strong>DMN</strong> will provide constructs spanning both decision requirements and
decision logic modeling. For decision requirements modeling, it defines
the concept of a Decision Requirements Graph (DRG) comprising a set of
elements and their connection rules, and a corresponding notation: The
Decision Requirements Diagram (DRD). For decision logic modeling it
provides a language called FEEL for defining and assembling decision
tables, calculations, if/then/else logic, simple data structures, and
externally defined logic from Java and PMML into executable expressions
with formally defined semantics. It also provides a notation for
decision logic (&quot;boxed expressions&quot;) allowing components of the decision
logic level to be drawn graphically and associated with elements of a
Decision Requirements Diagram. The relationship between these constructs
is shown in Figure 5-2.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 5-2: DMN Constructs</strong></p>
<h2>Scope and uses of DMN</h2>
<p>Decision modeling is carried out by business analysts in order to
understand and define the decisions used in a business or organization.
Such decisions are typically operational decisions made in day-to-day
business processes, rather than the strategic decision-making for which
fewer rules and representations exist.</p>
<p>Three uses of <strong>DMN</strong> can be discerned in this context:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For modeling human decision-making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For modeling the requirements for automated decision-making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For implementing automated decision-making.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Modeling human decision-making</h3>
<p><strong>DMN</strong> may be used to model the decisions made by personnel within an
organization. Human decision-making can be broken down into a network of
interdependent constituent decisions and modeled using a DRD. The
decisions in the DRD would probably be described at quite a high level,
using natural language rather than decision logic.</p>
<p>Knowledge sources may be defined to model governance of decision-making
by people (e.g., a manager), regulatory bodies (e.g., an ombudsman),
documents (e.g., a policy booklet) or bodies of legislation (e.g., a
government statute). These knowledge sources may be linked together, for
example to show that a decision is governed (a) by a set of regulations
defined by a regulatory body, and (b) by a company policy document
maintained by a manager.</p>
<p>Business knowledge models may be used to represent specific areas of
business knowledge drawn upon when making decisions. This will allow
<strong>DMN</strong> to be used as a tool for formal definition of requirements for
knowledge management. Business knowledge models may be linked together
to show the interdependencies between areas of knowledge (in a manner
similar to that used in the existing technique of Knowledge Structure
Mapping). Knowledge sources may be linked to the business knowledge
models to indicate how the business knowledge is governed or maintained,
for example to show that a set of business policies (the business
knowledge model) is defined in a company policy document (the knowledge
source).</p>
<p>In some cases, it may be possible to define specific rules or algorithms
for the decision-making. These may be modeled using decision logic
(e.g., business rules or decision tables) to specify business knowledge
models in the DRD, either descriptively (to record how decisions are
currently made, or how they were made during a particular period of
observation) or prescriptively (to define how decisions should be made
or will be made in the future).</p>
<p>Decision-making modeled in <strong>DMN</strong> may be mapped to tasks or activities
within a business process modeled using <strong>BPMN</strong>. At a high level, a
collaborative decision-making task may be mapped to a subset of
decisions in a DRD representing the overall decision-making behavior of
a group or department. At a more detailed level, it is possible to model
the interdependencies between decisions made by a number of individuals
or groups using <strong>BPMN</strong> collaborations: each participant in the
decision-making is represented by a separate pool in the collaboration
and a separate DRD in the decision model. Decisions in those DRDs are
then mapped to tasks in the pools, and input data in the DRDs are mapped
to the content of messages passing between the pools.</p>
<p>The combined use of <strong>BPMN</strong> and <strong>DMN</strong> thus provides a graphical
language for describing multiple levels of human decision-making within
an organization, from activities in business processes down to a
detailed definition of decision logic. Within this context <strong>DMN</strong>
models will describe collaborative organizational decisions, their
governance, and the business knowledge required for them.</p>
<h3>Modeling requirements for automated decision-making</h3>
<p>The use of <strong>DMN</strong> for modeling the requirements for automated
decision-making is similar to its use in modeling human decision-making,
except that it is entirely prescriptive, rather than descriptive, and
there is more emphasis on the detailed decision logic.</p>
<p>For full automation of decisions, the decision logic must be complete,
i.e., capable of providing a decision result for any possible set of
values of the input data.</p>
<p>However, partial automation is more common, where some decision-making
remains the preserve of personnel. Interactions between human and
automated decision-making may be modeled using collaborations as above,
with separate pools for human and automated decision-makers, or more
simply by allocating the decision-making to separate tasks in the
business process model, with user tasks for human decision-making and
business rule tasks for automated decision-making. So, for example, an
automated business rules task might decide to refer some cases to a
human reviewer; the decision logic for the automated task needs to be
specified in full but the reviewer's decision-making could be left
unspecified.</p>
<p>Once decisions in a DRD are mapped to tasks in a <strong>BPMN</strong> business
process flow, it is possible to validate across the two levels of
models. For example, it is possible to verify that all input data in the
DRDs are provided by previous tasks in the business process, and that
the business process uses the results of decisions only in subsequent
tasks or gateways. <strong>DMN</strong> models the relationships between Decisions
and Business Processes so that the Decisions that must be made for a
Business Process to complete can be identified and so that the specific
decision-making tasks that perform or execute a Decision can be
specified. No formal mapping of <strong>DMN</strong> ItemDefinition or <strong>DMN</strong>
InputData to <strong>BPMN</strong> DataObject is proposed but an implementation could
include such a check in a situation where such a mapping could be
determined.</p>
<p>Together, <strong>BPMN</strong> and <strong>DMN</strong> therefore allow specification of the
requirements for automated decision-making and its interaction with
human decision making within business processes. These requirements may
be specified at any level of detail, or at all levels. The three-tier
mapping between business process models, DRDs and decision logic will
allow the definition of these requirements to be supported by
model-based computer-aided design tools.</p>
<h3>Implementing automated decision-making</h3>
<p>If all decisions and business knowledge models are fully specified using
decision logic, it becomes possible to execute decision models.</p>
<p>One possible scenario is the use of &quot;decision services&quot; deployed from a
Business Rules Management System (BRMS) and called by a Business Process
Management System (BPMS). A decision service encapsulates the decision
logic supporting a DRD, providing interfaces that correspond to subsets
of input data and decisions within the DRD. When called with a set of
input data, the decision service will evaluate the specified decisions
and return their results. The constraint in <strong>DMN</strong> that all decision
logic is free of side-effects means that decision services will comply
with SOA principles, simplifying system design. Note that decision
services may also be invoked internal to the decision model, a trait
that they share with business knowledge models.</p>
<p>The structure of a decision model, as visualized in the DRD, may be used
as a basis for planning an implementation project. Specific project
tasks may be included to cover the definition of decision logic (e.g.,
rule discovery using human experts, or creation of analytic models), and
the implementation of components of the decision model.</p>
<p>Some decision logic representing the business knowledge encapsulated in
decision services needs to be maintained over time by personnel
responsible for the decisions, using special &quot;knowledge maintenance
interfaces&quot;. <strong>DMN</strong> supports the effective design and implementation of
knowledge maintenance interfaces: any business knowledge requiring
maintenance should be modeled as business knowledge models in the DRD,
and the responsible personnel as knowledge sources. DRDs then provide a
specification of the required knowledge maintenance interfaces and their
users, and the decision logic specifies the initial configuration of the
business knowledge to be maintained.</p>
<p>Other decision logic needs to be refreshed by regular analytic modeling.
The representation of business knowledge models as functions in <strong>DMN</strong>
makes the use of analytic models in decision services very simple: any
analytic model capable of representation as a function may be directly
called by or imported into a decision service.</p>
<h3>Combining applications of modelling</h3>
<p>The three contexts described above are not mutually exclusive
alternatives; a large process automation project might use <strong>DMN</strong> in
all three ways.</p>
<p>First, the decision-making within the existing process might be modeled,
to identify the full extent of current decision making and the areas of
business knowledge involved. This &quot;as-is&quot; analysis provides the baseline
for process improvement.</p>
<p>Next, the process might be redesigned to make the most effective use of
both automated and human decision-making, often using collaboration
between the two (e.g., using automated referrals to human
decision-makers, or decision support systems which advise or constrain
the user). Such a redesign involves modeling the requirements for the
decision making to occur in each process task and the roles and
responsibilities of individuals or groups in the organization. This
model provides a &quot;to-be&quot; specification of the required process and the
decision-making it coordinates.</p>
<p>Comparison of the &quot;as-is&quot; and &quot;to-be&quot; models will indicate requirements
not just for automation technology, but for change management: changes
in the roles and responsibilities of personnel, and training to support
new or modified business knowledge.</p>
<p>Finally, the &quot;to-be&quot; model will be implemented as executable system
software. Provided the decision logic is fully specified in FEEL and/or
other external logic (e.g., externally defined Java methods or PMML
models), components of the decision model may be implemented directly as
software components.</p>
<p><strong>DMN</strong> does not prescribe any particular methodology for carrying out
the above activities; it only supports the models used for them.</p>
<h2>Basic concepts</h2>
<h3>Decision requirements level</h3>
<p>The word &quot;decision&quot; has two definitions in common use: it may denote the
act of choosing among multiple possible options; or it may denote the
option that is chosen. In this specification, we adopt the former usage:
a <strong>decision</strong> is the act of determining an <strong>output</strong> value (the chosen
option), from a number of <strong>input</strong> values, using logic defining how the
output is determined from the inputs. This <strong>decision logic</strong> may
include one or more <strong>business knowledge models</strong> which encapsulate
business know-how in the form of business rules, analytic models, or
other formalisms. This basic structure, from which all decision models
are built, is shown in Figure 5-3.</p>
<p><img src="media/image4.jpg" alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;2.2465277777777777in&quot;
height=&quot;1.2729166666666667in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 5-3: Basic elements of a decision model</strong></p>
<p>For simplicity and generality, many of the figures in this specification
show each decision as having a single associated business knowledge
model, but it should be noted that <strong>DMN</strong> does not require this to be
the case. The use of business knowledge models to encapsulate decision
logic is a matter of style and methodology, and decisions may be modeled
with no associated business knowledge models, or with several. Similar
to business knowledge models, decision services may also be used to
encapsulate decision logic for reuse inside the decision model, but for
simplicity such examples will be presented starting in the section
describing decision services.</p>
<p>Authorities may be defined for decisions or business knowledge models,
which might be (for example) domain experts responsible for defining or
maintaining them, or source documents from which business knowledge
models are derived or sets of test cases with which the decisions must
be consistent. These are called <strong>knowledge sources</strong> (see Figure 5-4).</p>
<p><img src="media/image5.jpg" alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;3.9625in&quot;
height=&quot;1.4777777777777779in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 5-4: Knowledge sources</strong></p>
<p>A decision is said to &quot;require&quot; its inputs in order to determine its
output. The inputs may be <strong>input data</strong>, or the outputs of other
decisions. (In either case they may be data structures, rather than just
simple data items.) If the inputs of a decision Decision1 include the
output of another decision Decision2, Decision1 &quot;requires&quot; Decision2.
Decisions may therefore be connected in a network called a <strong>Decision
Requirements Graph (DRG)</strong>, which may be drawn as a <strong>Decision</strong>
<strong>Requirements Diagram</strong> (<strong>DRD</strong>). A DRD shows how a set of decisions
depend on each other, on input data, and on business knowledge models. A
simple example of a DRD with only two decisions is shown in Figure 5-5.</p>
<p><img src="media/image6.jpg" alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;3.5166666666666666in&quot;
height=&quot;1.7534722222222223in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 5-5: A simple Decision Requirements Diagram (DRD)</strong></p>
<p>A decision may require multiple business knowledge models, and a
business knowledge model may require multiple other business knowledge
models, as shown in Figure 5-6.</p>
<p>This will allow (for example) the modeling of complex decision logic by
combining diverse areas of business knowledge, and the provision of
alternative versions of decision logic for use in different situations.</p>
<p><img src="media/image7.jpg" alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;3.4805555555555556in&quot;

<p><strong>Figure 5-6: Combining business knowledge models</strong></p>
<p>DRGs and their notation as DRDs are specified in detail in clause 0.</p>
<h3>Decision logic level</h3>
<p>The components of the decision requirements level of a decision model
may be described, as they are above, using only business concepts. This
level of description is often sufficient for business analysis of a
domain of decision-making, to identify the business decisions involved,
their interrelationships, the areas of business knowledge and data
required by them, and the sources of the business knowledge. Using
decision logic, the same components may be specified in greater detail,
to capture a complete set of business rules and calculations, and (if
desired) to allow the decision making to be fully automated.</p>
<p>Decision logic may also provide additional information about how to
display elements in the decision model. For example, the decision logic
element for a decision table may specify whether to show the rules as
rows or as columns. The decision logic element for a calculation may
specify whether to line up terms vertically or horizontally.</p>
<p>The correspondence between concepts at the decision requirements level
and the decision logic level is described below. Please note that in the
figures below, as in Figure 5-1and Figure 5-2, the grey ellipses and
dotted lines are drawn only to indicate correspondences between concepts
in different levels for the purposes of this introduction. They do <em>not</em>
form part of the notation of <strong>DMN</strong>, which is formally defined in
clauses 6.2, 8.2, and 10.2. It is envisaged that implementations will
provide facilities for moving between levels of modeling, such as
&quot;opening&quot;, &quot;drilling down&quot; or &quot;zooming in&quot;, but <strong>DMN</strong> does not specify
how this should be done.</p>
<p>At the decision logic level, every decision in a DRG is defined using a
<strong>value expression</strong> which specifies how the decision's output is
determined from its inputs. At that level, the decision is considered to
<em>be</em> the evaluation of the expression. The value expression may be
notated using a <strong>boxed expression</strong>, as shown in Figure 5-7.</p>
<p><img src="media/image8.jpg" alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;6.206944444444445in&quot;
height=&quot;2.3868055555555556in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 5-7: Decision and corresponding value expression</strong></p>
<p>In the same way, at the decision logic level, a business knowledge model
is defined using a value expression that specifies how an output is
determined from a set of inputs. In a business knowledge model, the
value expression is encapsulated as a function definition, which may be
invoked from a decision's value expression.</p>
<p>The interpretation of business knowledge models as functions in <strong>DMN</strong>
means that the combination of business knowledge models as in Figure 5-6
has the clear semantics of functional composition. The value expression
of a business knowledge model may be notated using a <strong>boxed function</strong>
definition, as shown in Figure 5-8. Similar to a business knowledge
model, the decision service element can also be invoked from a
decision's value expression (see clause 5.3.3).</p>
<p><img src="media/image9.jpg" alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;6.768055555555556in&quot;
height=&quot;1.8576388888888888in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 5-8: Business knowledge model and corresponding value
expression</strong></p>
<p>A business knowledge model may contain any decision logic which is
capable of being represented as a function. This will allow the import
of many existing decision logic modeling standards (e.g., for business
rules and analytic models) into <strong>DMN</strong>. An important format of business
knowledge, specifically supported in <strong>DMN</strong>, is the Decision Table.
Such a business knowledge model may be notated using a <strong>Decision
Table</strong>, as shown in Figure 5-9.</p>
<p><img src="media/image10.jpg" alt="" />{width=&quot;6.768055555555556in&quot;
height=&quot;2.589583333333333in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 5-9: Business knowledge model and corresponding decision
table</strong></p>
<p>In most cases, the logic of a decision is encapsulated into business
knowledge models, and the value expression associated with the decision
specifies how the business knowledge models are invoked, and how the
results of their invocations are combined to compute the output of the
decision. The decision's value expression may also specify how the
output is determined from its input entirely within itself, without
invoking a business knowledge model: in that case, no business knowledge
model is associated with the decision (neither at the decision
requirements level nor at the decision logic level).</p>
<p>An expression language for defining decision logic in <strong>DMN</strong>, covering
all the above concepts, is specified fully in clause 10. This is
<strong>FEEL</strong>: The Friendly Enough Expression Language. The notation for
Decision Tables is specified in detail in clause 8.</p>
<h3>Decision services</h3>
<p>A decision service defines reusable logic within the decision model. A
decision service exposes one or more decisions from a decision model as
a reusable element, a service, which might be consumed (for example)
internally by another decision in the decision model, or externally by a
task in a <strong>BPMN</strong> process model. When the service is called with the
necessary input data and decision results, it returns the outputs of the
exposed decisions. Any decision service encapsulating a <strong>DMN</strong> decision
model will be stateless and have no side effects.</p>
<p>One important use of <strong>DMN</strong> will be to define decision-making logic to
be automated using decision services. When the decision service is
invoked externally, it might be implemented, for example, as a web
service. <strong>DMN</strong> does not specify how such services should be
implemented, but it allows the functionality of a service to be defined
against a decision model. The decision service therefore must be defined
in a DRD. When invoked internally from a decision the decision service
is invoked, similar to a BKM, by binding expressions in the logic of the
calling decision to parameters in the invoked decision service.</p>
<p>It is assumed that the client requires a certain set of decisions to be
made, and that the service is created to meet that requirement. The sole
function of the decision service is to return the results of evaluating
that set of decisions (the</p>
<p>&quot;output decisions&quot;). The service may be provided with the results of
decisions evaluated externally to the service (the &quot;input decisions&quot;).
The service must encapsulate not just the output decisions but also any
decisions in the DRG directly or indirectly required by the output
decisions which are not provided in the input decisions (the
&quot;encapsulated decisions&quot;).</p>
<p>The interface to the decision service will consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Input data: instances of all the input data required by the
encapsulated decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Input decisions: instances of the results of all the input
decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Output decisions: the results of evaluating (at least) all the
output decisions, using the provided input decisions and input data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When the service is called, providing the input data and input
decisions, it returns the output decisions.</p>
<p>Note that to define a decision service it is only necessary to specify
the output decisions and either the input decisions or the encapsulated
decisions. The remaining attributes (the required input data, and
whichever of the encapsulated or input decisions was not specified) may
then be inferred from the decision model against which the service is
defined. Alternatively, if more attributes are defined than are strictly
necessary, they may be validated against the decision model.</p>
<p>Figure 5-10 shows a decision service defined against a decision model
that includes three decisions. The output decisions for this service are
{Decision 1}, and the input decisions are {}, that is, the service
returns the result of Decision 1 and is not provided with the results of
any external decisions. Since Decision 1 requires Decision 2, which is
not provided to the service as input, the service must also encapsulate
Decision 2. Decision 3 is not required to be encapsulated. The
encapsulated decisions are therefore {Decision 1, Decision 2}. The
service requires Input data 1 and Input data 2, but not Input data 3.</p>
<p><img src="media/image11.jpg" alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;4.4709951881014875in&quot;

<p><strong>Figure 5-10: A decision service</strong></p>
<p>Multiple decision services may be defined against the same decision
model. Figure 5-11shows a decision service defined against the same
decision model, whose output decisions are {Decision 1} and whose input
decisions are {Decision 2}. The encapsulated decisions for this service
are {Decision 1}. The service requires Input data 1, but not Input data
2 or Input data 3.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 5-11: A decision service taking a decision as input</strong></p>
<p>In its simplest form a decision service would always evaluate all the
decisions in the output set, set and return all their results.</p>
<p>For computational efficiency various improvements to this basic
interpretation can be imagined, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An optional input parameter specifying a list of &quot;requested
decisions&quot; (a subset of the minimal output set). Only the results of
the requested decisions would be returned in the output context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An optional input parameter specifying a list of &quot;known decisions&quot;
(a subset of the encapsulation set), with their results. The
decision service would not evaluate these decisions but would use
the provided input values directly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All such implementation details are left to the software provider.</p>
<p>A decision service is &quot;complete&quot; if it contains decision logic for
evaluating all the encapsulated decisions on all possible input data
values. A request to the service is &quot;valid&quot; if instances are provided
for all the input decisions and input data required by those decisions
which need to be evaluated, i.e., (in the simple case) all the
encapsulated decisions, or (assuming the optional parameters above) any
requested decisions and any encapsulated decisions required by them
which are not already known.</p>
<h1>Requirements (DRG and DRD)</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The decision requirements level of a decision model in <strong>DMN</strong> consists
of a Decision Requirements Graph (DRG) depicted in one or more Decision
Requirements Diagrams (DRDs).</p>
<p>A DRG models a domain of decision-making, showing the most important
elements involved in it and the dependencies between them. The elements
modeled are decisions, areas of business knowledge, sources of business
knowledge, input data and decision services:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>Decision</strong> element denotes the act of determining an output from
a number of inputs, using decision logic which may reference one or
more Business Knowledge Models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>Business Knowledge Model</strong> element denotes a function
encapsulating business knowledge, e.g., as business rules, a
decision table, or an analytic model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <strong>Input Data</strong> element denotes information used as an input by
one or more Decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>Knowledge Source</strong> element denotes an authority for a Business
Knowledge Model or Decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>Decision Service</strong> element denotes a set of reusable decisions
that can be invoked internally or externally.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The dependencies between these elements express three kinds of
requirements: information, knowledge, and authority:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An <strong>Information Requirement</strong> denotes Input Data or Decision output
being used as input to a Decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>Knowledge Requirement</strong> denotes the invocation of a Business
Knowledge Model or Decision Service by the decision logic of a
Decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <strong>Authority Requirement</strong> denotes the dependence of a DRG element
on another DRG element that acts as a source of guidance or
knowledge.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DRDs may also contain any number of artifacts representing annotations
of the diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Text Annotation is modeler-entered text used for comment or
explanation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An Association is a dotted connector used to link a Text Annotation
to a DRG Element</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Group is a visual mechanism to group elements of a diagram
informally.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These components are summarized in Table 1 and described in more detail
in clause 6.2.</p>
<p>A DRG is a graph composed of elements connected by requirements and is
self-contained in the sense that all the modeled requirements for any
Decision in the DRG (its immediate sources of information, knowledge,
and authority) are present in the same DRG. It is important to
distinguish this complete definition of the DRG from a DRD presenting
any particular view of it, which may be a partial or filtered display:
see clause 6.2.4.</p>
<h2>Notation</h2>
<p>The notation for all components of a DRD is summarized in Table 1 and
described in more detail below.</p>

<h3>DRD Elements</h3>
<h4>Decision notation</h4>
<p>A Decision is represented in a DRD as a rectangle, normally drawn with
solid lines, as shown in Table 1. The Name of the Decision MUST be
displayed inside the shape unless it is overridden by the text attribute
of the associated DMNDI:DMNLabel element, which MUST be displayed
instead.</p>
<p>If the Listed Input Data option is exercised (see 6.2.1.3), all the
Decision's requirements for Input Data SHALL be listed beneath the
Decision's Name and separated from it by a horizontal line, as shown in
Figure 6-1. The listed Input Data names SHALL be clearly inside the
shape of the DRD element.</p>

height=&quot;1.0in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 6-1: Decision with Listed Input Data option</strong></p>
<p>The properties of a Decision are listed and described in 6.3.6.</p>
<h4>Business Knowledge Model notation</h4>
<p>A Business Knowledge Model is represented in a DRD as a rectangle with
two clipped corners, normally drawn with solid lines, as shown in
Table 1. The Name of the Business Knowledge Model MUST be displayed
inside the shape unless it is overridden by the text attribute of the
associated DMNDI:DMNLabel element, which MUST be displayed instead.</p>
<p>The properties of a Business Knowledge Model are listed and described in
6.3.8.</p>
<h4>Input Data notation</h4>
<p>An Input Data element is represented in a DRD as a shape with two
parallel straight sides and two semi-circular ends, normally drawn with
solid lines, as shown in Table 1. The Name of the Input Data element
MUST be displayed inside the shape unless it is overridden by the text
attribute of the associated DMNDI:DMNLabel element, which MUST be
displayed instead.</p>
<p>An alternative compliant way to display requirements for Input Data,
especially useful when DRDs are large or complex, is that Input Data are
not drawn as separate notational elements in the DRD but are instead
listed on those Decision elements which require them. For convenience in
this specification this is called the &quot;Listed Input Data&quot; option.
Implementations MAY offer this option. Figure 6-2 shows two equivalent
DRDs, one drawing Input Data elements, the other exercising the Listed
Input Data option. Note that if an Input Data element is not displayed
it SHALL be listed on all Decisions which require it (unless it is
deliberately hidden as discussed in 6.2.4).</p>

<h4>Knowledge Source notation</h4>
<p>A Knowledge Source is represented in a DRD as a shape with three
straight sides and one wavy one, normally drawn with solid lines, as
shown in Table 1. The Name of the Knowledge Source MUST be displayed
inside the shape unless it is overridden by the text attribute of the
associated DMNDI:DMNLabel element, which MUST be displayed instead.</p>
<p>The properties of a Knowledge Source element are listed and described in
6.3.12.</p>
<h3>DRD Requirements</h3>
<h4>Information Requirement notation</h4>
<p>Information Requirements may be drawn from Input Data elements to
Decisions, and from Decisions to other Decisions. They represent the
dependency of a Decision on information from input data or the results
of other Decisions. They may also be interpreted as data flow: a DRD
displaying only Decisions, Input Data and Information Requirements is
equivalent to a dataflow diagram showing the communication of
information between those elements at evaluation time. The Information
Requirements of a valid DRG form a directed acyclic graph.</p>
<p>An Information Requirement is represented in a DRD as an arrow drawn
with a solid line and a solid arrowhead, as shown in Table 1. The arrow
is drawn in the direction of information flow, i.e., towards the
Decision that requires the information.</p>
<h4>Knowledge Requirement notation</h4>
<p>Knowledge Requirements may be drawn from invocable elements (Business
Knowledge Models or Decision Services) to Decisions and from invocable
elements to Business Knowledge Models. They represent the invocation of
an invocable element when making a decision. If <em>e</em> is a decision or a
BKM in some DRD, and <em>e</em> contains a knowledge requirement on some
invocable element <em>b</em>, then the logic of <em>e</em> must contain an invocation
expression of <em>b</em>, including expressions for each of <em>b</em>'s parameters.</p>
<p>A Knowledge Requirement is represented in a DRD as an arrow drawn with a
dashed line and an open arrowhead, as shown in Table 1. The arrows are
drawn in the direction of the information flow of the result of
evaluating the function, i.e., toward the element that requires the
business knowledge.</p>
<h4>Authority Requirement notation</h4>
<p>Authority Requirements may be used in two ways:</p>
<p>a)  They may be drawn from Knowledge Sources to Decisions, Business
Knowledge Models, and other Knowledge Sources, where they represent
the dependence of the DRD element on the knowledge source. This
might be used to record the fact that a set of business rules must
be consistent with a published document (e.g., a piece of
legislation or a statement of business policy), or that a specific
person or organizational group is responsible for defining some
decision logic, or that a decision is managed by a person or group.
An example of this use of Knowledge Sources is shown in Figure 6-3:
in this case the Business Knowledge Model requires two sources of
authority -- a policy document and legislation -- and the policy
document requires the authority of a policy group.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 6-3: Knowledge Sources representing authorities</strong></p>
<p>b)  They may be drawn from Input Data and Decisions to Knowledge
Sources, where, in conjunction with use (a), they represent the
derivation of Business Knowledge Models from instances of Input Data
and Decision results, using analytics. The Knowledge Source
typically represents the analytic model (or modeling process); the
Business Knowledge Model represents the executable logic generated
from or dependent on the model. An example of this use of a
Knowledge Source is shown in Figure 6-4: in this case a business
knowledge model is based on an analytic model which is derived from
input data and the results of a dependent decision.</p>

height=&quot;1.8402777777777777in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 6-4: Knowledge source representing predictive analytics</strong></p>
<p>However, the figures above are only examples. There are many other
possible use cases for Authority Requirements (and since Knowledge
Sources and Authority Requirements have no execution semantics their
interpretation is necessarily vague), so this specification leaves the
details of their application to the implementer.</p>
<p>An Authority Requirement is represented in a DRD as an arrow drawn with
a dashed line and a filled circular head, as shown in Table 1. The
arrows are drawn from the source of authority to the element governed by
it.</p>
<h3>Connection rules</h3>
<p>The rules governing the permissible ways of connecting elements with
requirements in a DRD are described in Clause 6.2.2 above and summarized
in Table 2. For clarity, a simple DRD is shown for each permissible
connection. In each of these diagrams, the upper (&quot;to&quot;) element requires
the lower (&quot;from&quot;) element.</p>
<p>Note that no requirements may be drawn terminating in Input Data, that
is, input data may have no requirements. Note also that the type of the
requirement is uniquely determined by the types of the two elements
connected.</p>

<p>: <strong>Table 2: Requirements connection rules</strong></p>
<h3>{#section .unnumbered}</h3>
<h3>Partial views and hidden information</h3>
<p>The metamodel (see 6.3) provides properties for each of the DRG elements
which would not normally be displayed on the DRD but provide additional
information about their nature or function. For example, for a Decision
these include properties specifying which <strong>BPMN</strong> processes and tasks
make use of the Decision. Implementations SHALL provide facilities for
specifying and displaying such properties.</p>
<p>For any significant domain of decision-making a DRD representing the
complete DRG may be a large and complex diagram. Implementations MAY
provide facilities for displaying DRDs which are partial or filtered
views of the DRG, e.g., by hiding categories of elements, or hiding or
collapsing areas of the network.</p>
<p>DRG Elements with requirements not displayed on the current DRD SHOULD
be notated with an ellipsis (...) to show that this is the case. For
example, see Figure 11-5.</p>
<p>Two examples of DRDs providing partial views of a DRG are shown in
Figure 6-5: DRD 1 shows only the immediate requirements of a single
decision; DRD 2 shows only Information Requirements and the elements
they connect.</p>
<p><img src="media/image41.jpg" alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;6.446527777777778in&quot;
height=&quot;3.720833333333333in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 6-5: DRDs as partial views of a DRG</strong></p>
<p>DRDs can be interchanged using the Diagram Interchange mechanism defined
in section 13.</p>
<h3>Decision service</h3>
<p>A Decision Service is represented in a DRD as rectangle with rounded
corners, drawn with a heavy solid border. The Name of the Decision
Service MUST be displayed inside the shape unless it is overridden by
the text attribute of the associated DMNDI:DMNLabel element, which MUST
be displayed instead. The border SHALL enclose all the encapsulated
decisions, and no other decisions or input data. The border MAY enclose
other DRG elements, but these will not form part of the definition of
the Decision Service.</p>
<p>If the set of output decisions is smaller than the set of encapsulated
decisions, the Decision Service SHALL be divided into two parts with a
straight solid line. One part SHALL enclose only the output decisions
and the Decision Service's Name; the other part SHALL enclose all the
encapsulated decisions which are not in the set of output decisions.
Either part MAY enclose other DRG elements, but these will not form part
of the definition of the Decision Service.</p>
<p>Figure 6-6 shows a Decision Service with two output decisions; other
examples (with a single output decision) are shown in Figure 5-10 and
Figure 5-11.</p>
<p><img src="media/image42.jpg" alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;3.0555555555555554in&quot;
height=&quot;1.875in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 6-6: Decision Service notation</strong></p>
<p>A decision service may be defined in one DRD and then shown in a
different DRD when invoked internally within the decision model by
another decision. In the case of a decision service invocation internal
to the decision model, a decision service may also be shown without the
details of its definition, as in a &quot;collapsed state&quot;. Figure 6-7
consists of two separate diagrams: DRD 1 shows the definition of
Decision service 1. In DRD 2, the same Decision service 1 is shown as
invoked by Decision 5. In DRD 2, Decision service 1 is shown in a
collapsed form.</p>
<p><img src="media/image43.jpg" alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;6.760624453193351in&quot;
height=&quot;2.2923972003499564in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 6-7: A decision service in expanded and collapsed form</strong></p>
<p>DRD 1 in Figure 6-7 shows that Decision service 1 has 2 inputs: Decision
4 and Input data 1. It is therefore inferred that Decision Service 1 has
2 input parameters with matching characteristics to Decision 4 and Input
data 1. DRD 2 in Figure 6-7 shows that Decision 5 has 2 dependencies but
whether these are mapped as parameters for the invocation of Decision
Service 1 cannot be determined from the diagram.</p>
<p>The information and authority requirements defined on Decision 2 in DRD
1 are not depicted in the collapsed form of Decision Service 1 shown in
DRD 2.</p>
<p><img src="media/image44.jpg" alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;5.866754155730534in&quot;
height=&quot;2.234734251968504in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 6-8: A decision service invoked in an expanded form</strong></p>
<p>DRDs 1 and 2 in Figure 6-7 and DRD 3 in Figure 6-8 are all congruent
within the same DRG. They all show different aspects of Decision
Service 1. DRD 3 shows an expanded form Decision service 1 being invoked
by Decision 5.</p>
<p>The constraint imposed on the rendering of decision services within a
DRD is that the same decision service MUST NOT be rendered both expanded
and collapsed within the same DRD. This stems from the general
restriction disallowing the same DMN Element to be present twice in the
same diagram.</p>
<p><img src="media/image45.jpg" alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;6.757492344706912in&quot;
height=&quot;2.347843394575678in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 6-9: A decision service defined as an overlay</strong></p>
<p>Decision services are defined as overlays and therefore do not
encapsulate the decisions within them. Therefore, the richness of
connections depicted in Figure 6-9 is allowed. In this DRD, Decision 7
is dependent on Decision 2.</p>
<h3>Identifying Collections</h3>
<p>Decisions and Input Data elements on a DRD can represent collections of
elements. Implementations MAY show this with the addition of ||| in
the shape. Implementations SHALL show this on all such DRD elements
within a DRG OR on no DRD elements.</p>
<p>A Decision is considered to represent a collection if the Decision's
decisionOutput InformationItem references an ItemDefinition with
isCollection = TRUE.</p>
<p>An InputData is considered to represent a collection if the InputData's
variable InformationItem references an ItemDefinition with isCollection
= TRUE.</p>
<p>Two examples, a Decision and an Input Data, are shown in Figure 6-10.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 6-11:</strong> DMNElement <strong>Class Diagram</strong></p>
<p>DMNElement is the abstract superclass for the decision model elements.
It provides the optional attributes id, description and label, which are
Strings which other elements will inherit. The id of a DMNElement is
further restricted to the syntax of an XML ID
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-2-20041028/datatypes.html#ID">(</a>,)<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC">https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC</a><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-2-20041028/datatypes.html#ID">[-xmlschema-2-20041028/datatypes.html#ID),]{.underline}</a>,)
and SHALL be unique within the decision model.</p>
<p>DMNElement has abstract specializations NamedElement and Expression
NamedElement adds the required attribute name, and includes the abstract
specializations BusinessContextElement and DRGElement, as well as
concrete specializations Definitions, ItemDefinition, InformationItem,
ElementCollection and DecisionService.</p>
<p>Table 3 presents the attributes and model associations of the DMNElement

<p><strong>Figure 6-12: Definitions Class Diagram</strong></p>
<p>The Definitions class is the outermost containing object for all
elements of a <strong>DMN</strong> decision model. It defines the scope of visibility
and the namespace for all contained elements. Elements that are
contained in an instance of Definitions have their own defined
life-cycle and are not deleted with the deletion of other elements. The
interchange of <strong>DMN</strong> files will always be through one or more
Definitions.</p>
<p>Definitions is a kind of NamedElement, from which an instance of
Definitions inherits the name and optional id, description, and label
attributes, which are Strings.</p>
<p>An instance of Definitions has a namespace, which is a String. The
namespace identifies the default target namespace for the elements in
the Definitions and follows the convention established by XML Schema.</p>
<p>An instance of Definitions may specify an expressionLanguage, which is a
URI that identifies the default expression language used in elements
within the scope of this Definitions. This value may be overridden on
each individual LiteralExpression. The language SHALL be specified in a
URI format. The default expression language is FEEL (clause 10),
indicated by the URI: &quot;<a href="https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/20230324/FEEL/">https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/20230324/FEEL/</a>&quot;.
The simple expression language S-FEEL (clause 9), being a subset of
FEEL, is indicated by the same URI. <strong>DMN</strong> provides a URI for
expression languages that are not meant to be interpreted automatically
(e.g., pseudo-code that may resemble FEEL but is not):
&quot;<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/uninterpreted/20140801">[http://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/uninterpreted/20140801]{.underline}&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>An instance of Definitions may specify a typeLanguage, which is a URI
that identifies the default type language used in elements within the
scope of this Definitions. For example, a typeLanguage value of</p>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">&quot;[http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema]{.underline}&quot;</a>
indicates that the data structures defined within that Definitions are,
by default, in the form of XML Schema types. If unspecified, the default
typeLanguage is FEEL. This value may be overridden on each individual
ItemDefinition.</p>
<p>The typeLanguage SHALL be specified in a URI format (the URI for FEEL is
&quot;<a href="https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/20230324/FEEL/">https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/20230324/FEEL/</a>&quot;; the URI</p>
<p><a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/uninterpreted/20140801">&quot;[http://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/uninterpreted/20140801]{.underline}&quot;</a>
can be used to indicate that a type definition is not meant to be
interpreted)).</p>
<p>An instance of Definitions may specify an exporter and exporterVersion,
which are Strings naming</p>
<p>the tool and version used to create the XML serialization. In standards
such as <strong>BPMN</strong>, this has been found to aid in model interchange
between tools.</p>
<p>An instance of Definitions is composed of zero or more drgElements,
which are instances of</p>
<p>DRGElement, zero or more elementCollections, which are instances of
ElementCollection, zero or more itemDefinitions, which are instances of
ItemDefinition and of zero or more businessContextElements, which are
instances of BusinessContextElement.</p>
<p>It may contain any number of associated import, which are instances of
Import. Imports are used to import elements defined outside of this
Definitions, e.g., in other Definitions elements, and to make them
available for use by elements in this Definitions.</p>
<p>Definitions inherits all the attributes and model associations from
NamedElement. Table 5 presents the additional attributes and model
associations of the Definitions element.</p>

<h3>Import metamodel</h3>
<p>The Import class is used when referencing external elements, either
<strong>DMN</strong> DRGElement or ItemDefinition instances contained in other
Definitions elements, or non-<strong>DMN</strong> elements, such as an XML Schema or
a PMML file. Imports SHALL be explicitly defined.</p>
<p>An instance of Import has an importType, which is a String that
specifies the type of import associated with the element. For example, a
value of
&quot;<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">[http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema]{.underline}&quot;</a>
indicates that the imported element is an XML schema. The <strong>DMN</strong>
namespace indicates that the imported element is a <strong>DMN</strong> Definitions
element.</p>
<p>The location of the imported element may be specified by associating an
optional locationURI with an instance of Import. The locationURI is a
URI.</p>
<p>An instance of Import has a namespace, which is a URI that identifies
the namespace of the imported element, and also a name, inherited from
NamedElement, which is a string that serves as a prefix in
namespace-qualified names, such as typeRefs specifying imported
ItemDefinitions and expressions referencing imported InformationItems.
The namespace value should be globally unique, but the import name,
which is typically a short business-friendly name,must be distinct from
the names of other imports, decisions, input data, business knowledge
models, decision services, and item definitions within the importing
model only. Multiple imports with empty import names are allowed in the
default namespace and their precedence is resolved according to their
definition order.</p>
<p>When the import name attribute is an empty string, the elements are
imported in the default namespace of the model. When a name collision
occurs between an element in the default namespace and an imported
element, the imported element does not replace the one already in the
default namespace while the elements without name collision are
imported.</p>
<p><strong>Table 6</strong> presents the attributes and model associations of the Import
element.</p>

+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+</p>
<p>: <strong>Table 8: Association attributes and model associations</strong></p>
<h3>Element Collection metamodel</h3>
<p>The ElementCollection class is used to define named groups of DRGElement
instances. ElementCollections may be used for any purpose relevant to an
implementation, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To identify the requirements subgraph of a set one or more decisions
(i.e., all the elements in the closure of the requirements of the
set).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To identify the elements to be depicted on a DRD.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ElementCollection is a kind of NamedElement, from which an instance of
ElementCollection inherits the name and optional id, description, and
label attributes, which are Strings. The id of an ElementCollection
element SHALL be unique within the containing instance of Definitions.</p>
<p>An ElementCollection element has any number of associated drgElements,
which are the instances of DRGElement that this ElementCollection
defines together as a group. Notice that an ElementCollection element
must reference the instances of DRGElement that it collects, not contain
them: instances of DRGElement can only be contained in Definitions
elements.</p>
<p>ElementCollection inherits all the attributes and model associations
from NamedElement. Table 7 presents the additional attributes and model
associations of the ElementCollection element.</p>

<h3>DRG Element metamodel</h3>
<p>DRGElement is the abstract superclass for all <strong>DMN</strong> elements that are
contained within Definitions and that have a graphical representation in
a DRD. All the elements of a <strong>DMN</strong> decision model that are not
contained directly in a Definitions element (specifically: all three
kinds of requirement, bindings, clause and decision rules, import, and
objective) SHALL be contained in an instance of DRGElement, or in a
model element that is contained in an instance of DRGElement,
recursively.</p>
<p>The specializations of DRGElement are Decision, InputData, Invocable,
and KnowledgeSource. Invocable is further specialized into
BusinessKnowledgeModel and DecisionService.</p>
<p>DRGElement is a specialization of NamedElement, from which it inherits
the name and optional id, description, and label attributes. The id of a
DRGElement element SHALL be unique within the containing instance of
Definitions.</p>
<p>A <strong>Decision Requirements Diagram</strong> (<strong>DRD</strong>) is the diagrammatic
representation of one or more instances of DRGElement and their
information, knowledge, and authority requirement relations. The
instances of DRGElement</p>
<p>are represented as the vertices in the diagram; the edges represent
instances of InformationRequirement,</p>
<p>KnowledgeRequirement or AuthorityRequirement (see clauses 6.3.13,
6.3.14, and 6.3.15). The connection rules are specified in 6.2.3).</p>
<p>DRGElement inherits all the attributes and model associations of
NamedElement. It does not define additional attributes and model
associations of the DRGElement element.</p>
<h3>Artifact metamodel</h3>
<p>Artifacts are used to provide additional information about a Decision
Model. DMN provides two standard Artifacts: Association and Text
Annotation. Associations can be used to link Artifacts to any
DMNElement.</p>
<h4>Association</h4>
<p>An Association is used to link information and Artifacts with DMN
graphical elements. Text Annotations and other Artifacts can be
associated with the graphical elements. An arrowhead on the Association
indicates a direction of flow (e.g., data), when appropriate.</p>
<p>The Association element inherits the attributes and model associations
of DMNElement (see Table 3). Table 8 presents the additional attributes
and model associations for an Association.</p>
<p>+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

| {None | One | Both}            | directionality with an arrowhead. |
|                                  | The default is None (no           |
|                                  | arrowhead). A value of One means  |
|                                  | that the arrowhead SHALL be at    |
|                                  | the Target Object. A value of     |
|                                  | Both means that there SHALL be an |
|                                  | arrowhead at both ends of the     |
|                                  | Association line.                 |

+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+</p>
<p>:  <strong>Table 10: TextAnnotation attributes</strong></p>
<h4>Group</h4>
<p>The <strong>Group</strong> object is an Artifact that provides a visual mechanism to
group elements of a diagram informally. <strong>Groups</strong> are often used to
highlight certain sections of a Diagram without adding additional
constraints for performance. The highlighted (grouped) section of the
Diagram can be separated for reporting and analysis purposes. <strong>Groups</strong>
do not affect the execution of the Decisions.</p>
<p>As an Artifact, a <strong>Group</strong> is not a DRGElement, and, therefore, cannot
be connected to/from an Information Requirement, Knowledge Requirement,
or Authority Requirement. It can only be connected to/from an
Association.</p>
<p>The Group element inherits the attributes and model associations of
Artifact. Table 9 presents the additional attributes and model
associations for a Group.</p>

<h4>Text Annotation</h4>
<p>Text Annotations are a mechanism for a modeler to provide additional
text information for the reader of a DMN Diagram.</p>
<p>The TextAnnotation element inherits the attributes and model
associations of DMNElement (see Table 3). Table 10 presents the
additional attributes for a TextAnnotation.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 6-13: Decision Class Diagram</strong></p>
<p>The class Decision is used to model a decision.</p>
<p>Decision is a concrete specialization of DRGElement and it inherits the
name and optional id, description and label attributes from NamedElement
The name of a Decision must be different from the name of any other
invocable, input data, decision, or import in the decision model.</p>
<p>In addition, it may have a question and allowedAnswers, which are all
strings. The optional description attribute is meant to contain a brief
description of the decision-making embodied in the Decision. The
optional question attribute is meant to contain a natural language
question that characterizes the Decision such that the output of the
Decision is an answer to the question. The optional allowedAnswers
attribute is meant to contain a natural language description of the
answers allowed for the question such as Yes/No, a list of allowed
values, a range of numeric values etc.</p>
<p>In a DRD, an instance of Decision is represented by a <strong>decision</strong>
diagram element.</p>
<p>A Decision element is composed of an optional decisionLogic, which is an
instance of Expression, and of zero or more informationRequirement,
knowledgeRequirement and authorityRequirement elements, which are
instances of InformationRequirement, KnowledgeRequirement and
AuthorityRequirement, respectively.</p>
<p>In addition, a Decision defines an InformationItem representing its
output. This InformationItem may include an optional typeRef, which
references an ItemDefinition or other type definition specifying the
datatype of the possible outcomes of the Decision.</p>
<p>The <strong>requirement subgraph</strong> of a Decision element is the directed graph
composed of the Decision element itself, its informationRequirements,
its knowledgeRequirements, and the union of the requirement subgraphs of
each requiredDecision or requiredKnowledge element: that is, the
requirement subgraph of a Decision element is the closure of the
informationRequirement, requiredInput, requiredDecision,
knowledgeRequirement and requiredKnowledge associations starting from
that Decision element.</p>
<p>An instance of Decision -- that is, the model of a decision -- is said
to be <strong>well-formed</strong> if and only if all of its informationRequirement
and knowledgeRequirement elements are well-formed, That condition
entails, in particular, that the requirement subgraph of a Decision
element SHALL be acyclic, that is, that a Decision element SHALL not
require itself, directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>Besides its logical components: information requirements, decision logic
etc, the model of a decision may also document a business context for
the decision (see clause 6.3.8 and Figure <strong>6-14</strong>).</p>
<p>The business context for an instance of Decision is defined by its
association with any number of supportedObjectives, which are instances
of Objective as defined in OMG BMM, any number of impactedPerformance
Indicators, which are instances of Performance Indicator, any number of
decisionMaker and any number of decisionOwner, which are instances of
OrganisationalUnit.</p>
<p>In addition, an instance of Decision may reference any number of
usingProcess, which are instances of Process as defined in OMG <strong>BPMN
2.0</strong>, and any number of usingTask, which are instances of Task as
defined in OMG <strong>BPMN 2.0</strong>, and which are the Processes and Tasks that
use the Decision element.</p>
<p>Decision inherits all the attributes and model associations from
DRGElement. Table 11 presents the additional attributes and model
associations of the Decision class.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 6-15: BusinessKnowledgeModel class diagram</strong></p>
<p>A business knowledge model has an abstract part, representing reusable,
invocable decision logic, and a concrete part, which mandates that the
decision logic must be a single FEEL boxed function definition. A
decision service is also an invocable element, and thus can be invoked
as required knowledge from other decisions and business knowledge
models.</p>
<p>The class Invocable is used to model an invocable element and the class
BusinessKnowledgeModel is used to model a business knowledge model.</p>
<p>Invocable is a specialization of DRGElement and it inherits the name and
optional id, description, and label attributes from NamedElement. The
name of an Invocable must be different from the name of any other
invocable, input data, decision, or import in the decision model.
BusinessKnowledgeModel is a specialization of Invocable from which it
additionally inherits the variable attribute.</p>
<p>A BusinessKnowledgeModel element may have zero or more
knowledgeRequirement, which are instance of KnowledgeRequirement, and
zero or more authorityRequirement, which are instances of
AuthorityRequirement. These model elements are described below.</p>
<p>The <strong>requirement subgraph</strong> of a BusinessKnowledgeModel element is the
directed graph composed of the</p>
<p>BusinessKnowledgeModel element itself, its knowledgeRequirement
elements, and the union of the requirement subgraphs of all the
requiredKnowledge elements that are referenced by its
knowledgeRequirements.</p>
<p>An instance of BusinessKnowledgeModel is said to be <strong>well-formed</strong> if
and only if, either it does not have any knowledgeRequirement, or all of
its knowledgeRequirement elements are well-formed. That condition
entails, in particular, that the requirement subgraph of a
BusinessKnowledgeModel element SHALL be acyclic, that is, that a
BusinessKnowledgeModel element SHALL not require itself, directly or
indirectly.</p>
<p>At the decision logic level, a BusinessKnowledgeModel element contains a
FunctionDefinition, which is an instance of Expression containing zero
or more parameters, which are instances of Information Item. The
FunctionDefinition that is contained in a BusinessKnowledgeModel element
is the reusable module of decision logic that is represented by this
BusinessKnowledgeModel element. An Invocable element contains an
InformationItem that holds an invocable reference to the abstract
business knowledge, which allows a Decision to invoke it by name. The
name of that InformationItem SHALL be the same as the name of the
Invocable element. Invocable inherits all the attributes and model
associations from DRGElement.</p>
<p>Table 15 presents the additional attributes and model associations of
the Invocable class. Table 16 presents the additional attributes and
model associations of the BusinessKnowledgeModel class.</p>

<p>The DecisionService class is used to define named decision services
against the decision model contained in an instance of Definitions.</p>
<p>DecisionService is a kind of Invocable element, from which an instance
of DecisionService inherits the name and optional id, description, and
label attributes, which are Strings, and a variable, which is an
InformationItem. The id of a DecisionService element SHALL be unique
within the containing instance of Definitions. The name of the variable
and the name of the DecisionService SHALL be the same. This name may be
used to invoke a DecisionService from the decision logic of another
decision or business knowledge model.</p>
<p>A DecisionService element has one or more associated outputDecisions,
which are the instances of Decision required to be output by this
DecisionService, i.e., the Decisions whose results the Decision Service
must return when called.</p>
<p>A DecisionService element has zero or more encapsulatedDecisions, which
are the instances of Decision required to be encapsulated by this
DecisionService, i.e., the Decisions to be evaluated by the Decision
Service when it is called.</p>
<p>A DecisionService element has zero or more inputDecisions, which are the
instances of Decision required as input by this DecisionService, i.e.,
the Decisions whose results will be provided to the Decision Service
when it is called.</p>
<p>A DecisionService element has zero or more inputData, which are the
instances of InputData required as input by this DecisionService, i.e.,
the Input Data which will be provided to the Decision Service when it is
called.</p>
<p>The encapsulatedDecisions, inputDecisions and inputData attributes are
optional. At least one of the encapsulatedDecisions and inputDecisions
attributes SHALL be specified.</p>
<p>The <strong>requirement subgraph</strong> of a DecisionService element is the
directed graph composed of the DecisionService element itself and the
union of the requirement subgraphs of all the Decision elements that are
referenced by its encapsulatedDecisions and outputDecisions.</p>
<p>An instance of DecisionService is said to be <strong>well-formed</strong> if and only

<h3>Information Requirement metamodel</h3>
<p>The class InformationRequirement is used to model an <strong>information
requirement</strong>, as represented by a plain arrow in a DRD.
InformationRequirement is a specialization of DMNElement, from which it
inherits the optional id, description, and label attributes.</p>
<p>An InformationRequirement element is a component of a Decision element,
and it associates that requiring Decision element with a
requiredDecision element, which is an instance of Decision, or a

Decision element, not contain it: instances of Decision or InputData can
only be contained in Definitions elements.</p>
<p>An instance of InformationRequirement is said to be <strong>well-formed</strong> if

<p>The <strong>DMN</strong> metamodel is aimed to be extensible. This allows <strong>DMN</strong>
adopters to extend the specified metamodel in a way that allows them to
be still <strong>DMN</strong>-compliant. It provides a set of extension elements,
which allows <strong>DMN</strong> adopters to attach additional attributes and
elements to standard and existing <strong>DMN</strong> elements. This approach
results in more interchangeable models because the standard elements are
still intact and can still be understood by other <strong>DMN</strong> adopters.
It's only the additional attributes and elements that MAY be lost
during interchange.</p>
<p>A <strong>DMN</strong> extension can be done using two different elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>ExtensionElements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ExtensionAttribute</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>ExtensionElements is a container for attaching arbitrary elements from
other metamodels to any <strong>DMN</strong> element. ExtensionAttribute allows these
attachments to also have name. This allows <strong>DMN</strong> adopters to integrate
any metamodel into the <strong>DMN</strong> metamodel and reuse already existing
model elements.</p>
<h4>ExtensionElements</h4>
<p>The ExtensionElements element is a container to aggregate elements from
other metamodels inside any DMNElement. Table 23 presents the attributes

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Examples of DRDs are provided in clause 11.1.3.</p>
<h1>Relating Decision Logic to Decision Requirements</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Clause 0 described how the decision requirements level of a decision
model -- a DRG represented in one or more DRDs -- may be used to model
the structure of an area of decision making. However, the details of how
each decision's outcome is derived from its inputs must be modeled at
the decision logic level. This section introduces the principles by
which decision logic may be associated with elements in the DRG.
Specific representations of decision logic (decision tables and FEEL
expressions) are then defined in clauses 8, 9 and 10.</p>
<p>The decision logic level of a decision model in <strong>DMN</strong> consists of one
or more value expressions. The elements of decision logic modeled as
value expressions include tabular expressions such as decision tables
and invocations, and literal (text) expressions such as <em>age &gt; 30</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>literal expression</strong> represents decision logic as text that
describes how an output value is derived from its input values. The
expression language may, but need not, be formal or executable:
examples of literal expressions include a plain English description
of the logic of a decision, a first order logic proposition, a Java
computer program and a PMML document. Clause10 specifies an
executable expression language called <strong>FEEL</strong>. Clause 9 specifies a
subset of FEEL (S-FEEL) that is the default language for literal
expressions in <strong>DMN</strong> decision tables (clause 8).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>decision table</strong> is a tabular representation of decision logic,
based on a discretization of the possible values of the inputs of a
decision, and organized into rules that map discretized input values
onto discrete output values (see clause 8).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <strong>invocation</strong> is a tabular representation of how decision logic
that is represented by a business knowledge model or a decision
service is invoked by a decision, or by another business knowledge
model. An invocation may also be represented as a literal
expression, but usually the tabular representation will be more
understandable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tabular representations of decision logic are called <em>boxed expressions</em>
in the remainder of this specification.</p>
<p>All three <strong>DMN</strong> conformance levels include all the above expressions.
At <strong>DMN</strong> Conformance Level 1, literal expressions are not interpreted
and, therefore, free. At <strong>DMN</strong> Conformance Level 2, literal
expressions are restricted to S-FEEL. Clause 10 specifies additional
boxed expressions available at <strong>DMN</strong> Conformance Level 3.</p>
<p>Decision logic is added to a decision model by including a value
expression component in some of the decision model elements in the DRG:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>From a decision logic viewpoint, a decision is a piece of logic that
defines how a given question is answered, based on the input data.
As a consequence, each <strong>decision</strong> element in a decision model may
include a value expression that describes how a decision outcome is
derived from its required input, possibly invoking a business
knowledge model;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From a decision logic viewpoint, a business knowledge model is a
piece of decision logic that is defined as a function allowing it to
be re-used in multiple decisions. As a consequence, each <strong>business
knowledge model</strong> element may include a value expression, which is
the body of that function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another key component of the decision logic level is the <strong>variable</strong>:
Variables are used to store values of Decisions and InputData for use in
value expressions. InformationRequirements specify variables in scope
via reference to those Decisions and InputData, so that value
expressions may reference these variables. Variables link information
requirements in the DRG to the value expressions at the decision logic
level:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>From a decision logic viewpoint, an information requirement is a
requirement for an externally provided value to be assigned to a
free variable in the decision logic, so that a decision can be
evaluated. As a consequence, each <strong>information requirement</strong> in a
decision model points to a Decision or InputData, which in turn
defines a variable that represents the associated data input in the
decision's expression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The variables that are used in the body of the function defined by a
business knowledge model element in the DRG must be bound to the
information sources in each of the requiring decisions. As a
consequence, each <strong>business knowledge model</strong> includes zero or more
variables that are the parameters of the function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The third key element of the decision logic level are the <strong>item
definitions</strong> that describe the types and structures of data items in a
decision model: <strong>input data</strong> elements in the DRG, and <strong>variables</strong>
and <strong>value expressions</strong> at the decision logic level, may reference an
associated item definition that describes the type and structure of the
data expected as input, assigned to the variable or resulting from the
evaluation of the expression.</p>
<p>Notice that <strong>knowledge sources</strong> are not represented at the decision
logic level: knowledge sources are part of the documentation of the
decision logic, not of the decision logic itself.</p>
<p>The dependencies between decisions, required information sources and
business knowledge models, as represented by the information and
knowledge requirements in a DRG, constrain how the value expressions
associated with these elements relate to each other.</p>
<p>As explained above, every decision, input data, and business knowledge
model at the DRG level is associated with a variable used at the
decision logic level. Each variable that is referenced by a decision's
expression must be associated with a required decision, required input
data, or required knowledge. Also, each variable associated with the
required decisions, required input data, and required knowledge SHOULD
be referenced in the decision's expression.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a decision requires another decision, the value expression of the
required decision assigns the value to the variable for use in
evaluating the requiring decision. This is the generic mechanism in
<strong>DMN</strong> for composing decisions at the decision logic level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a decision requires an input data, the value of the variable is
assigned the value of the data source attached to the input data at
execution time. This is the generic mechanism in <strong>DMN</strong> for
instantiating the data requirements for a decision.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The input variables of a decision's decision logic must not be used
outside that value expression or its component value expressions: the
decision element defines the lexical scope of the input variables for
its decision logic. To avoid name collisions and ambiguity, the name of
a variable must be unique within its scope. When DRG elements are mapped
to FEEL, the name of a variable is the same as the (possibly qualified)
name of its associated input data or decision, which guarantees its
uniqueness.</p>
<p>When DRG elements are mapped to FEEL, all the decisions and input data
in a DRG define a <em>context</em>, which is the literal expression that
represents the logic associated with the decision element and that
represents that scope (see 9.3.2.8). The information requirement
elements in a decision are <em>context entries</em> in the associated context,
where the <em>key</em> is the name of the variable that the information
requirement defines, and where the <em>expression</em> is the <em>context</em> that is
associated with the required decision or input data element that the
information requirement references. The value expression that is
associated with the decision as its decision logic is the <em>expression</em>
in the <em>context entry</em> that specifies what is the result of the
<em>context</em>.</p>
<p>In the same way, a business knowledge model element defines the lexical
scope of its parameters, that is, of the input variables for its body.</p>
<p>In FEEL, the literal expression and scoping construct that represents
the logic associated with a business knowledge model element is a
<em>function definition</em> (see 10.3.2.13), where the <em>formal parameters</em> are
the names of the parameters in the business knowledge model element, and
the expression is the value expression that is the body of the business
knowledge model element.</p>
<p>If a business knowledge model element requires one or more other
business knowledge models, it SHOULD have an explicit value expression
that describes how the required business knowledge models are invoked
and their results combined or otherwise elaborated.</p>
<h2>Notation</h2>
<h3>Expressions</h3>
<p>We define a graphical notation for decision logic called <strong>boxed
expressions</strong>. This notation serves to decompose the decision logic
model into small pieces that can be associated with DRG artifacts. The
DRD plus the boxed expressions form a complete, mostly graphical
language that completely specifies Decision Models.</p>
<p>In addition to the generic notation of <strong>boxed expression</strong>, this
section specifies two kinds of boxed expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>boxed literal expression</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>boxed invocation</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The boxed expression for a decision table is defined in clause 8.
Further types of boxed expressions are defined for FEEL, in clause 10.</p>
<p>Boxed expressions are defined recursively, <em>i.e.,</em> boxed expressions can
contain other boxed expressions. The top-level boxed expression
corresponds to the decision logic of a single DRG artifact. This boxed
expression SHALL have a name box that contains the name of the DRG

<p>Name is the only visual link defined between DRD elements and boxed
expressions. Graphical tools are expected to support appropriate
graphical links, for example, clicking on a decision shape opens a
decision table. How the boxed expression is visually associated with the
DRD element is left to the implementation.</p>
<h3>Boxed literal expression</h3>
<p>In a boxed expression, a literal expression is represented by its text.
However, two notational conventions are provided to improve the
readability of boxed literal expressions: typographical string literals
and typographical date and time literals.</p>
<h4>Typographical string literals</h4>
<p>A string literal such as &quot;DECLINED&quot; can be represented alternatively
as the italicized literal <em>DECLINED</em>. For example, Figure 7-3 is
equivalent to Figure 7-4:</p>
<p><img src="media/image58.jpg" alt="Table Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;4.716270778652668in&quot;
height=&quot;1.885411198600175in&quot;}</p>

height=&quot;1.9957961504811899in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 7-4: Decision table with string literals</strong></p>
<p>To avoid having to discern whether (e.g.,) <em>HIGH, DECLINE</em> is &quot;HIGH,&quot;
&quot;DECLINE,&quot; or &quot;HIGH, DECLINE,&quot; typographical string literals SHALL
be free of commas (&quot;,&quot; characters). FEEL typographical string literals
SHALL conform to grammar rule 22 (name).</p>
<h4>Typographical date and time literals</h4>
<p>A date, time, date and time, or duration expression such as
date(&quot;2013-08-09&quot;) can be represented alternatively as the bold
italicized literal <strong><em>2013-08-09</em>.</strong> The literal SHALL obey the syntax
specified in clauses 10.3.2.3.4, 10.3.2.3.5, and 10.3.2.3.7.</p>
<h3>Boxed invocation</h3>
<p>An invocation is a container for the parameter bindings that provide the
context for the evaluation of the body of a business knowledge model.</p>
<p>The representation of an invocation is the name of the business
knowledge model with the parameters' bindings explicitly listed.</p>
<p>As a boxed expression, an invocation is represented by a box containing
the name of the business knowledge model to be invoked, and boxes for a
list of bindings, where each binding is represented by two boxed
expressions on a row: the box on the left contains the name of a
parameter, and the box on the right contains the binding expression,
that is the expression whose value is assigned to the parameter for the
purpose of evaluating the invoked business knowledge model (see Figure
7-5).</p>

<p><strong>Figure 7-5: Boxed invocation</strong></p>
<p>The invoked business knowledge model is represented by the name of the
business knowledge model. Any other visual linkage is left to the
implementation.</p>
<h2>Metamodel</h2>
<p>An important characteristic of decisions and business knowledge models
is that they may contain an expression that describes the logic by which
a modeled decision shall be made, or pieces of that logic.</p>
<p>The class Expression is the abstract superclass for all expressions that
are used to describe complete or parts of decision logic in <strong>DMN</strong>
models and that return a single value when interpreted (clause 7.3.1).
Here &quot;single value&quot; possibly includes structured data, such as a
decision table with multiple output clauses.</p>
<p><strong>DMN</strong> defines three concrete kinds of Expression: LiteralExpression,
DecisionTable (see 8) and Invocation.</p>
<p>An expression may reference variables, such that the value of the
expression, when interpreted, depends on the values assigned to the
referenced variables. The class InformationItem is used to model
variables in expressions.</p>
<p>The value of an expression, like the value assigned to a variable, may
have a structure and a range of allowable values. The class
ItemDefinition is used to model data structures and ranges.</p>

<h3>Expression metamodel</h3>
<p>An important characteristic of decisions and business knowledge models
is that they may contain an expression that describes the logic by which
a modeled decision shall be made, or pieces of that logic.</p>
<p>Expression is an abstract specialization of DMNElement, from which it
inherits the optional id, description, and label attributes.</p>
<p>An instance of Expression is a component of a Decision element, of a
BusinessKnowledgeModel element, or of an ItemDefinition element, or it
is a component of another instance of Expression, directly or
indirectly.</p>
<p>An Expression references zero or more variables implicitly by using
their names in its expression text. These variables, which are instances
of InformationItem, are lexically scoped, depending on the Expression
type. If the Expression is the logic of a Decision, the scope includes
that Decision's requirements. If the Expression is the body of the
encapsulatedLogic of a BusinessKnowledgeModel, the scope includes the
FunctionDefinition's parameters and the BusinessKnowledgeModel's
requirements. If the Expression is the value of a ContextEntry, the
scope includes the previous entries in the Context. An instance of
Expression references an optional typeRef, which points to either a base
type in the default typeLanguage, a custom type specified by an
ItemDefinition, or an imported type. The referenced type specifies the
Expression's range of possible values. If an instance of Expression
that defines the output of a Decision element includes a typeRef, the
referenced type SHALL be the same as the type of the containing Decision
element.</p>
<p>An instance of Expression can be interpreted to derive a single value
from the values assigned to its variables. How the value of an
Expression element is derived from the values assigned to its
variablesdepends on the concrete kind of the Expression. The
ItemDefinition element specializes NamedElement and it inherits its
attributes and model associations. Table 26 presents the additional
attributes and model associations of the ItemDefinition element.</p>
<p>Expression inherits from the attributes and model associations of
DMNElement.</p>
<h3>UnaryTests Metamodel</h3>
<p>The class UnaryTests is used to model a boolean test where the argument
to be tested is implicit or denoted with a ?, and whose value is
specified by text in some specified expression language.</p>
<p>UnaryTests is a concrete subclass of Expression.</p>
<p>An instance of UnaryTests inherits an optional typeRef from Expression,
which SHALL NOT be used. An instance of UnaryTests also has an optional
text, which is a String, and an optional expressionLanguage, which is a
String that identifies the expression language of the text. If no
expressionLanguage is specified, the expression language of the text is
the expressionLanguage that is associated with the containing instance
of Definitions. The expressionLanguage SHALL be specified in a URI
format. The default expression language is FEEL. When the expression
language is FEEL, the text must conform to grammar rule 15 in section
10.3.1.2.</p>
<p>A UnaryTests is satisfied if and only if one of the following
alternatives is true:</p>
<p>a) One of the expressions in the UnaryTests evaluates to a value, and
the implicit value is equal to that value.</p>
<p>b) One of the expressions in the UnaryTests evaluates to a list of
values, and the implicit value is equal to at least one of the values in
that list.</p>
<p>c) One of the expressions in the UnaryTests evaluates to true when the
implicit value is applied to it.</p>
<p>d) One of the expressions in the UnaryTests is a boolean expression
using the special '?' variable and that expression evaluates to true
when the implicit value is assigned to '?'.</p>
<p>Table 25 presents additional attributes and model associations of the
UnaryTests element.</p>

<h3>ItemDefinition metamodel</h3>
<p>The inputs and output of decisions, business knowledge models, and
decision services, and the output of input data (all DRGElements) are
data items whose value, at the logic level, is assigned to variables or
represented by</p>
<p>Expressions.</p>
<p>An important characteristic of data items in decision models is their
structure. <strong>DMN</strong> does not require a particular format for this data
structure, but it does designate a subset of FEEL as its default.</p>
<p>The class ItemDefinition is used to model the structure and the range of
values of the input and the outcome of decisions.</p>
<p>As a concrete specialization of NamedElement, an instance of
ItemDefinition has a name and an optional id and description. The name
of an ItemDefinition element SHALL be distinct from the names of other
ItemDefinitions and Imports within the same model.</p>
<p>The default type language for all elements can be specified in the
Definitions element using the typeLanguage attribute. For example, a
typeLanguage value of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">[http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema]{.underline}&quot;</a>
indicates that the data structures used by elements within that
Definitions are in the form of XML Schema types. If unspecified, the
default is FEEL.</p>
<p>Notice that the data types that are built-in in the typeLanguage that is
associated with an instance of Definitions need not be redefined by
ItemDefinition elements contained in that Definitions element: they are
considered imported and can be referenced in <strong>DMN</strong> elements within the
Definitions element.</p>
<p>The type language can be overridden locally using the typeLanguage
attribute in the ItemDefinition element.</p>
<p>Notice, also, that the data types and structures that are defined at the
top level in a data model that is imported using an Import element that
is associated with an instance of Definitions need not be redefined by
ItemDefinition elements contained in that Definitions element: they are
considered imported and can be referenced in <strong>DMN</strong> elements within the
Definitions element.</p>
<p>An ItemDefinition element MAY have a typeRef, which is a string that
references, as a qualified name, either an ItemDefinition in the current
instance of Definitions or a built-in type in the specified typeLanguage
or a type defined in an imported DMN, XSD, or other document. In the
latter case, the external document SHALL be imported in the Definitions
element that contains the instance of ItemDefinition, using an Import
element specifying both the namespace value and its name when used a
qualifier. For example, in the case of data structures contributed by an
XML schema, an Import would be used to specify the file location of that
schema, and the typeRef attribute would reference the type or element
definition in the imported schema. If the type language is FEEL the
built-in types are the FEEL built-in data types: <em>number</em>, <em>string</em>,
<em>boolean</em>, <em>days and time duration</em>, <em>years and months duration</em>, <em>date,
time</em>, <em>date, and time</em> and <em>Any</em>. A typeRef referencing a built-in type
SHALL omit the prefix.</p>
<p>An ItemDefinition element may restrict the values that are allowed from
typeRef, using the allowedValues attribute. allowedValues is an instance
of UnaryTests that constrains the domain of the typeRef. If an
ItemDefinition element does not contain allowedValues, its range of
allowed values is the full range of the referenced typeRef. When an
ItemDefinition has sibling itemComponents, their values are available in
the evaluation context of the UnaryTests of the allowedValues. In cases
where the isCollection attribute of an ItemDefinition is true, each
element of the collection must satisfy the UnaryTests of the
allowedValues, i.e. the allowedValues are projected onto the collection
elements. The default value of isCollection is false. The allowedValues
attribute has been deprecated as of DMN 1.5 and replaced with the
typeConstraint attribute. The typeConstraint attribute differs from
allowedValues by not projecting onto collection elements but directly
constraining the collection.<br />
An alternative way to define an instance of ItemDefinition is as a
composition of ItemDefinition elements. An instance of ItemDefinition
may contain zero or more itemComponent, which are themselves</p>
<p>ItemDefinitions. Each itemComponent in turn may be defined by either a
typeRef and allowedValues or a nested itemComponent. In this way,
complex types may be defined within DMN. The name of an itemComponent
(nested ItemDefinition) must be unique within its containing
ItemDefinition or itemComponent.</p>
<p>An alternative way to define an instance of ItemDefinition is by
specifying a FunctionItem element, which defines the signature of a
function: the parameters and the output of the function. An instance of
ItemDefinition may contain at most one FunctionItem. A FunctionItem may
contain zero or more parameters defined as InformationItems and one
output type defined as a typeRef. The names of the parameters of a
FunctionItem are unique.</p>
<p>An ItemDefinition element SHALL be defined using only one of the
alternative ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>reference to a built-in or imported typeRef, possibly restricted
with allowedValues;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>composition of ItemDefinition elements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>function signature element.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The ItemDefinition element specializes NamedElement and it inherits its
attributes and model associations. Table 26 presents the additional
attributes and model associations of the ItemDefinition element.</p>

<h3>InformationItem metamodel</h3>
<p>The class InformationItem is used to model variables at the decision
logic level in decision models.</p>
<p>InformationItem is a concrete subclass of NamedElement, from which it
inherits the id, and optional name, description, and label attributes,
except that an InformationItem element SHALL have a name attribute,
which is the name that is used to represent it in other Expression
elements. The name of an InformationItem element SHALL be unique within
its scope.</p>
<p>Variables represent values that result from a decision, are assigned to
input data by an external data source or are passed to a module of
decision logic that is defined as a function (and that is represented by
a business knowledge model element). In the first or second case, a
variable may be referenced by other dependent decisions by means of
their information requirements. In the third case, a variable is one of
the parameters of the function that is the realization, at the decision
logic level, of a business knowledge model element.</p>
<p>A variable representing an instance of Decision or InputData referenced
by aInformationRequirement</p>
<p>SHOULD be referenced by the value expression of the decision logic in
the Decision element that contains the InformationRequirement element. A
parameter in an instance of BusinessKnowledgeModel SHOULD be a variable
in the value expression of that BusinessKnowledgeModel element.</p>
<p>An InformationItem element contained in a Decision is assigned the value
of the Decision's value expression.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An InformationItem element that is a parameter in a
FunctionDefinition is assigned a value by a Binding element as part
of an instance of Invocation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An InformationItem element contained in an InputData is assigned a

</li>
<li>
<p>An InformationItem element contained in a ContextEntry is assigned a

</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, the datatype indicated by the typeRef that is associated
with an instance of InformationItem SHALL be compatible with the
datatype that is associated with the <strong>DMN</strong> model element from which it
takes its value. InformationItem inherits all of the attributes and
model associations of NamedElement. Table 28 presents the additional
attributes and model associations of the InformationItem element.</p>

<h3>Literal expression metamodel</h3>
<p>The class LiteralExpression is used to model a value expression whose
value is specified by text in some specified expression language.</p>
<p>LiteralExpression is a concrete subclass of Expression, from which it
inherits the id and typeRef attributes.</p>
<p>An instance of LiteralExpression has an optional text, which is a
String, and an optional expressionLanguage, which is a String that
identifies the expression language of the text. If no expressionLanguage
is specified, the expression language of the text is the
expressionLanguage that is associated with the containing instance of
Definitions. The expressionLanguage SHALL be specified in a URI format.
The default expression language is FEEL.</p>
<p>As a subclass of Expression, each instance of LiteralExpression has a
value. The text in an instance of LiteralExpression determines its
value, according to the semantics of the LiteralExpression's
expressionLanguage. The semantics of <strong>DMN</strong> decision models as
described in this specification applies only if the text of all the
instances of LiteralExpression in the model are valid expressions in
their associated expression language.</p>
<p>An instance of LiteralExpression may include importedValues, which is an
instance of a subclass Import that identifies where the text of the
LiteralExpression is located. importedValues is an expression that
selects text from an imported document. An instance of LiteralExpression
SHALL NOT have both a text and importedValues. The importType of the
importedValues identifies the type of document containing the imported
text and SHALL be consistent with the expressionLanguage of the
LiteralExpression element. The expressionLanguage of the importedValues
element identifies how the imported text is selected from the imported
document. For example, if the importType indicates an XML document, the
expressionLanguage of importedValues could be XPATH 2.0.</p>
<p>LiteralExpression inherits of all the attributes and model associations
of Expression. Table 29 presents the additional attributes and model
associations of the LiteralExpression element.</p>

<h3>Invocation metamodel</h3>
<p>Invocation is a mechanism that permits the evaluation of one value
expression -- the invoked expression <em>--</em> inside another value
expression -- the invoking expression -- by binding locally the input
variables of the invoked expression to values inside the invoking
expression. In an invocation, the input variables of the invoked
expression are usually called: <em>parameters</em>. Invocation permits the same
value expression to be re-used in multiple expressions, without having
to duplicate it as a sub-expression in all the using expressions.</p>
<p>The class Invocation is used to model invocations as a kind of
Expression: Invocation is a concrete specialization of Expression.</p>
<p>An instance of Invocation is made of zero or more binding, which are
instances of Binding, and model how the bindingFormulas are bound to the
formalParameters of the invoked function. The formalParameters of a
FunctionDefinition are InformationItems and the parameters of the
Bindings are InformationItems. The binding is by matching the
InformationItem names.</p>
<p>An Invocation contains a calledFunction, an Expression, which must
evaluate to a function. Most commonly, it is a LiteralExpression naming
a BusinessKnowledgeModel.</p>
<p>The value of an instance of Invocation is the value of the associated
calledFunction's body, with its formalParameters assigned values at
runtime per the bindings in the Invocation.</p>
<p>Invocation MAY be used to model invocations in decision models, when a
Decision element has exactly one knowledgeRequirement element, and when
the decisionLogic in the Decision element consists only in invoking the
BusinessKnowledgeModel element that is referenced by that
requiredKnowledge and a more complex value expression is not required.</p>
<p>Using Invocation instances as the decisionLogic in Decision elements
permits the re-use of the encapsulatedLogic of a BusinessKnowledgeModel
as the logic for any instance of Decision that requires that
BusinessKnowledgeModel, where each requiring Decision element specifies
its own bindings for the encapsulatedLogic's parameters.</p>
<p>The calledFunction that is associated with the Invocation element SHALL
BE the encapsultedLogic of the BusinessKnowledgeModel element that is
required by the Decision element that contains the Invocation. The
Invocation element SHALL have exactly one binding for each parameter in
the BusinessKnowledgeModel's encapsulatedLogic.</p>
<p>Invocation inherits of all the attributes and model associations of
Expression. Table 30 presents the additional attributes and model
associations of the Invocation element.</p>

<h1>Decision Table</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>One of the ways to express the decision logic corresponding to the DRD
decision artifact is as a decision table. A decision table is a tabular
representation of a set of related input and output expressions,
organized into rules indicating which output entry applies to a specific
set of input entries. The decision table contains all (and only) the
inputs required to determine the output. Moreover, a complete table
contains all possible combinations of input values (all the rules).</p>
<p>Decision tables and decision table hierarchies have a proven track
record in decision logic representation. It is one of the purposes of
<strong>DMN</strong> to standardize different forms and types of decision tables.</p>
<p>A decision table consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An information item name: the name of an InformationItem, if any,
for which the decision table is its value expression. This will
usually be the name of the Decision or Business Knowledge Model for
which the decision table provides the decision logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of input clauses (zero or more). Each input clause is made of
an input expression and optional allowed values for the input
entries that correspond to the clause. The input entries are
contained in the rules, and the <em>i</em>th input entry corresponds to the
<em>i</em>^th^ input clause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of output clauses (one or more). Each output clause is made
of a name and optional allowed values for the output entries that
correspond to the clause. The output entries are contained in the
rules, and the ith output entry corresponds to the ith output
clause. A single output clause has no name. Two or more output
clauses describe a decision table that returns a context for each
hit with an entry for each output clause. Each of the multiple
output clauses SHALL be named.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A set of outputs (one or more). A single output has no name, only a
value. Two or more outputs are called output components. Each output
component SHALL be named. Each output (component) SHALL specify an
output entry for each rule. The specification of output component
name (if multiple outputs) and all output entries is referred to as
an output clause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of annotation clauses (zero or more). Each annotation clause
is made of a name. Each annotation SHALL be named as part of a rule
annotation clause. The annotation entries are contained in the
rules, and the ith annotation entry corresponds to the i^th^
annotation clause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of rules (one or more) in rows or columns of the table
(depending on orientation), where each rule is composed of the
specific input entries, output entries and optional rule annotations
of the table row (or column). If the rules are expressed as rows,
the columns are clauses, and vice versa.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Figure 8-4: Decision table example (horizontal orientation, multiple
output components)</strong></p>
<p>The decision table shows the rules in a shorthand notation by arranging
the entries in table cells. This shorthand notation shows all inputs in
the same order in every rule and therefore has a number of readability
and verification advantages.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>+-------------------------+--------------------------+----------------+
| &gt; Customer              | &gt; OrderSize              | Discount       |
+=========================+==========================+================+
| &gt; <em>Business</em>            | &gt; &lt;10                   | 0.10           |
+-------------------------+--------------------------+----------------+</p>
<p>: <strong>Table 38: Examples of decision tables</strong></p>
<p>reads as:</p>
<p><strong>If</strong> Customer = &quot;Business&quot; <strong>and</strong> OrderSize &lt; 10 <strong>then</strong> Discount =
0.10 In general, this is expressed as:</p>
<p>+------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------+
| &gt; input expression 1   | &gt; input expression 2    | Output label      |
+========================+=========================+===================+
| &gt; input entry a        | &gt; input entry b         | output entry c    |
+------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------+</p>
<p>: <strong>Table 39: FEEL range comparisons</strong></p>
<p>The three highlighted cells in the decision table fragment above
represent the following rule:</p>
<p><strong>If</strong> the value of input expression 1 satisfies input entry a</p>
<p><strong>and</strong> the value of input expression 2 satisfies input entry b</p>
<p><strong>then</strong> the rule <em>matches</em> and the result of the decision table is
output entry c.</p>
<p>An input expression value <em>satisfies</em> an input entry if the value is
equal to the input entry or belongs to the list of values indicated by
the input entry (e.g., a list or a range), or one of the expressions in
the input entry evaluates to true. For the complete specification of the
input entry satisfaction conditions, please refer to section 8.3.3. If
the input entry is '-' (meaning <em>irrelevant</em>), every value of the input
expression satisfies the input entry, and that particular input is
irrelevant in the specified rule.</p>
<p>A rule <em>matches</em> if the value of every input expression satisfies the
corresponding input entry. If there are no input entries, any rule
matches.</p>
<p>The list of rules expresses the logic of the decision. For a given set
of input values, the matching rule (or rules) indicate the resulting
value for the output name. If rules <em>overlap</em>, multiple rules can match,
and a <em>hit policy</em> indicates how to handle the multiple matches.</p>
<p>If two input entries of the same input expression share no values, the
entries (cells) are called <em>disjoint</em>. If there is an intersection, the
entries are called <em>overlapping</em> (or even equal). 'Irrelevant' ('-')
overlaps with any input entry of the input expression.</p>
<p>Two rules are overlapping if all corresponding input entries are
<em>overlapping</em>. A specific configuration of input data may then match the
two rules.</p>
<p>Two rules are <em>disjoint</em> (non-overlapping) if at least one pair of
corresponding input expressions is disjoint. No specific configuration
of input data will match the two rules.</p>
<p>If tables are allowed to contain overlapping rules, the table hit policy
indicates how overlapping rules have to be handled and which is the
resulting value(s) for the output name, in order to avoid inconsistency.</p>
<h2>Notation</h2>
<p>This section builds on the generic notation for decision logic and boxed
expressions defined in clause 7.2. A decision table representation
standardizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The orientation (rules as rows, columns, or crosstab), as shown by
the table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Placement of inputs, outputs and (optional) allowed values in
standard locations on a grid of cells. Each input expression is
optionally associated with unary tests restricting the allowed input
values. In this text the optional cells with allowed values are
indicated in inverse. Each output (component) is optionally
associated with allowed values. In this text the optional allowed
output values are indicated in inverse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Line style and optional use of color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contents of specific rule input and output entry cells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hit policy, indicating how to interpret overlapping input
combinations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Placement of information item name, hit policy (H) and rule numbers
as indicated in Figure 8-5, Figure 8-7 and Figure 8-9. Rule numbers
are consecutive natural numbers starting at 1. Rule numbering is
required for tables with hit indicator F (first) or R (rule order)
because the meaning depends on rule sequence. Crosstab tables have
no rule numbers. Rule numbering is optional for other table types.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Input expressions, input values, output values, input entries and output
entries can be any text (e.g., natural language, formal language,
pseudo-code). Implementations claiming level 2 or 3 conformance SHALL
support (S-)FEEL syntax. Implementations claiming level 1 conformance
are not required to interpret the expressions. To avoid
misinterpretation (e.g., when expressions are not meant to be valid
(S-)FEEL but may conflict with the look and feel of (S-)FEEL syntax),
conformant implementations SHOULD indicate when the input expression is
not meant to be interpreted by using the URI:
&quot;<a href="https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/uninterpreted/20140801">https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/uninterpreted/20140801</a><a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/uninterpreted/20140801">&quot;</a>.</p>
<h3>Line style and color</h3>
<p>Line style is normative. There is a double line between the input
clauses and output clauses, continuing between the input entries and the
output entries. There is also a double line between the output clauses
and the annotation clauses, continuing between the output entries and
the annotation entries. These two double lines are parallel to each
other. There is a third double line, that intersects at right angles
with the previous two, between input clauses and the input entries,
continuing between the output clauses and the output entries, and
continuing between the annotation clauses and the annotation entries.
All other cells are separated by a single line.</p>
<p>Color is suggested but does not influence the meaning. It is considered
good practice to use different colors for the input clauses, the output
clauses, and the annotation clauses, and another (or no) color for the
input, output, and annotation entries.</p>
<h3>Table orientation</h3>
<p>Depending on size, a decision table can be presented horizontally (rules
as rows), vertically (rules as columns), or crosstab (rules composed
from two input dimensions). Crosstab tables can only have the default
hit policy (see later).</p>
<p>Decision table inputs and outputs should not be mixed. In a horizontal
table, all input columns SHALL be represented on the left of all output
columns. In a vertical table, all the input rows SHALL be represented
above all output rows. In a crosstab, all the output cells SHALL be in
the bottom-right part of the table.</p>
<p>The table SHALL be arranged in one of the following ways (see Figure
8-5, Figure 8-7, Figure 8-9). Cells indicated in inverse are optional.</p>
<p>The input cell entry '-' means 'irrelevant'. HC is a placeholder for hit
policy indicator (e.g., U, A, F, ...).</p>

<p>**<br />
**<strong>Figure 8-11: Rules as crosstab - example with three inputs</strong></p>
<p>Crosstab tables with more than two inputs are possible (as shown in
Figure 8-11).</p>
<h3>Input expressions</h3>
<p>Input expressions are usually simple, for example, a name (e.g.,
CustomerStatus) or a test (e.g., Age&lt;25). The order of input
expressions is not related to any execution order in implementation.</p>
<h3>Input values</h3>
<p>Input expressions may be expected to result in a limited number or a
limited range of values. It is important to model these expected input
values because a decision table will be considered complete if its rules
cover all combinations of expected input values for all input
expressions.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the expected input values are modeled, input values
SHOULD be exclusive and complete. Exclusive means that input values are
disjoint. Complete means that all relevant input values from the domain
are present.</p>
<p>For example, the following two input value ranges overlap: &lt;5, &lt;10.
The following two ranges are incomplete: &lt;5, &gt;5. The list of input
values is optional. If provided, it is a list of unary tests that must
be satisfied by the corresponding input.</p>
<h3>Information Item names, output labels, and output component names</h3>
<p>A decision table with multiple output components SHALL specify a name
for each output component.</p>
<p>A decision table that is the value expression of an InformationItem
(e.g., a Decision's logic or a boxed Invocation's binding formula)
SHALL specify the name of the InformationItem as its Information Item
name. A decision table that is not contained in another boxed expression
shall place the Information Item name in a name box just above and
adjoining the table.</p>
<p>A decision table that is contained in another boxed expression may use
the containing expression for its</p>
<p>Information Item name. For example, the Information Item name for a
decision table bound to a function parameter is the name of the function
parameter. Or, to save space, the Information Item name box may be
omitted, and the Output label used instead.</p>
<p>Output values</p>
<p>The output entries of a decision table are often drawn from a list of
output values.</p>
<p>The list of output values is optional. If provided, it is a list
restricting output entries to the given list of values.</p>
<p>When the hit policy is P (priority), meaning that multiple rules can
match, but only one hit should be returned, the ordering of the list of
output values is used to specify the (decreasing) priority.</p>
<p>The ordering of the list of output values is also used when the hit
policy is output order.</p>
<h3>Multiple outputs</h3>
<p>The decision table can show a compound output (see Figure 8-12, Figure
8-13, and Figure 8-14).</p>
<p><img src="media/image75.jpg" alt="Table Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;5.2917596237970255in&quot;

height=&quot;1.7729352580927384in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 8-14: Crosstab with multiple output components</strong></p>
<h3>Input entries</h3>
<p>Rule input entries are unary tests (grammar rule 15).</p>
<p>A dash symbol ('-') can be used to mean any input value, <em>i.e.,</em> the
input is irrelevant for the containing rule.</p>
<p>The input entries in a unary test SHOULD be '-' or a subset of the input
values specified. For example, if the input values for input 'Age' are
specified as <em>[0..120]</em>, then an input entry of <em>&lt;0</em> SHOULD be
reported as invalid.</p>
<p>Tables containing at least one '-' input entry are called <em>contracted</em>
tables. The others are called <em>expanded</em>.</p>
<p>Tables where every input entry is <em>true, false, or '-</em>' are historically
called <em>limited-entry</em> tables, but there is no need to maintain this
restriction.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the input expressions in a decision table does not produce
side-effects that influence the evaluation of other input expressions.
This means that evaluating an expression or executing a rule should not
change the evaluation of other expressions or rules of the same table.
This is particularly important in first hit tables where the rules are
evaluated in a predefined sequence: evaluating or executing a rule
should not influence other rules.</p>
<h3>Merged input entry cells</h3>
<p>Adjacent input entry cells from different rules, with the same content
and same (or no) prior cells can be merged, as shown in Figure 8-15 and
Figure 8-16. Rule output cells cannot be merged (except in crosstabs).</p>

<p><strong>Figure 8-16: Merged rule input cells not allowed</strong></p>
<h3>Output entry</h3>
<p>A rule output entry is an expression.</p>
<p>Rule output cells cannot be merged (except in crosstabs, where adjacent
output cells with the same content can be merged).</p>
<h4>Shorthand notation</h4>
<p>In vertical (rules as columns) tables with a single output name (equal
to the information item name), a shorthand notation may be used to
indicate: output value applies ('X') or does not apply ('-'), as is
common practice in decision tables.</p>
<p>Because there can be only one output entry for an output name, every
rule must indicate no more than one 'X'. The other output entries must
contain '-'.</p>
<p>The table in Figure 8-17 is shorthand notation for the table in Figure
8-18. It is called shorthand, because the output entries need not be
(re-)written in every column but are indicated with a one-character
notation ('X' or '-'), thereby saving space in vertical tables, which
tend to expand in width as the number of rules increases. The output
values are written only once, before the rules, in the output expression
part.</p>
<p>If an information item name is provided, and there is only one output
name (which has to be equal to the information item name), the output
name is optional.</p>

<h3>Hit policy</h3>
<p>A decision table normally has several rules. As a default, rules do not
overlap. If rules overlap, meaning that more than one rule may match a
given set of input values, the hit policy indicator is required in order
to recognize the table type and unambiguously understand the decision
logic. The hit policy can be used to check correctness at design-time.</p>
<p>The hit policy specifies what the result of the decision table is in
cases of overlapping rules, i.e., when more than one rule matches the
input data. For clarity, the hit policy is summarized using a single
character in a particular decision table cell. In horizontal tables this
is the top-left cell (Figure 8-2) and in vertical tables this is the
bottom-left cell (Figure 8-1).</p>
<p><img src="media/image64.jpg" alt="Diagram, schematic Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;6.754371172353456in&quot;
height=&quot;3.483180227471566in&quot;}</p>
<p>The character is the initial letter of the defined hit policy
(<strong>U</strong>nique, <strong>A</strong>ny, <strong>P</strong>riority, <strong>F</strong>irst, <strong>C</strong>ollect, <strong>O</strong>utput
order or <strong>R</strong>ule order). Crosstab tables are always Unique and need no
indicator.</p>
<p>The hit policy SHALL default to Unique, in which case the hit indicator
is optional. Decision tables with the Unique hit policy SHALL NOT
contain overlapping rules.</p>
<p>Tools may support only a nonempty subset of hit policies, but the table
type SHALL be clear and therefore the hit policy indication is
mandatory, except for the default unique tables. Unique tables SHALL
always be supported.</p>
<h4>Single and multiple hit tables</h4>
<p>A single hit table shall return the output of one rule only; a multiple
hit table may return the output of multiple rules (or a function of the
outputs, e.g., sum of values). If rules are allowed to overlap, the hit
policy indicates how overlapping rules have to be interpreted.</p>
<p>The initial letter for hit policy also identifies if a table is single
hit or multiple hits.</p>
<p>A single hit table may or may not contain overlapping rules but returns
the output of one rule only. In case of overlapping rules, the hit
policy indicates which of the matching rules to select. Some
restrictions apply to tables with compound outputs.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether a single or multiple hit policy is used, some
columns in a decision table may be designated as <em>rule annotations</em>.
Rule Annotations contain text that is not returned as part of the
expression results, and they are ignored for purposes of the hit policy
validations described below. Although there is no standard mechanism to
access the annotations of the matched rules in a decision table at
execution time, implementations may use the annotations for auditing,
debugging, logging, documentation, analytics, consumption by down-stream
systems, or for other purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Single hit policies</strong> for single output decision tables are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>U</strong>nique: no overlap is possible, and all rules are disjoint. Only
a single rule can be matched. This is the default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A</strong>ny: there may be overlap, but all the matching rules show equal
output entries for each output (ignoring rule annotations), so any
match can be used. If the output entries are non-equal (ignoring
rule annotations), the hit policy is incorrect, and the result is
undefined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P</strong>riority: multiple rules can match, with different output
entries. This policy returns the matching rule with the highest
output priority. Output priorities are specified in the ordered list
of output values, in decreasing order of priority. Note that
priorities are independent from rule sequence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>F</strong>irst: multiple (overlapping) rules can match, with different
output entries. The first hit by rule order is returned (and
evaluation can halt). This is still a common usage because it
resolves inconsistencies by forcing the first hit. However, first
hit tables are not considered good practice because they do not
offer a clear overview of the decision logic. It is important to
distinguish this type of table from others because the meaning
depends on the order of the rules. The last rule is often the
catch-remainder. Because of this order, the table is hard to
validate manually and therefore has to be used with care.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A multiple hit table may return output entries from multiple rules. The
result will be a list of rule outputs or a simple function of the
outputs.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple hit policies</strong> for single output decision tables can be:</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p><strong>O</strong>utput order: returns all hits in decreasing output priority
order. Output priorities are specified in the ordered list of output
values in decreasing order of priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>R</strong>ule order: returns all hits in rule order. Note: the meaning
may depend on the sequence of the rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>C</strong>ollect: returns all hits in arbitrary order. An operator ('+',
'&lt;', '&gt;', '#') can be added to apply a simple function to the
outputs. If no operator is present, the result is the list of all
the output entries. Collect operators are:</p>
<p>a.  + (sum): the result of the decision table is the sum of all the
outputs.</p>
<p>b.  &lt; (min): the result of the decision table is the smallest value
of all the outputs.</p>
<p>c.  &gt; (max): the result of the decision table is the largest value
of all the outputs.</p>
<p>d.  # (count): the result of the decision table is the number of
outputs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Other policies, such as more complex manipulations on the outputs, can
be performed by post-processing the output list (outside the decision
table).</p>
<p>Decision tables with compound outputs support only the following hit
policies: Unique, Any, Priority, First, Output order, Rule order and
Collect without operator, because the collect operator is undefined over
multiple outputs. This restriction ignores rule annotations of which
there may be multiple regardless of the hit policy specified.</p>
<p>For the Priority and Output order hit policies, priority is decided in
compound output tables over all the outputs for which output values have
been provided (ignoring rule annotations). The priority for each output
is specified in the ordered list of output values in decreasing order of
priority, and the overall priority is established by considering the
ordered outputs from left to right in horizontal tables (i.e., columns
to the left take precedence over columns to the right), or from top to
bottom in vertical tables. Outputs for which no output values are
provided are not considered in the ordering, although their output
entries are included in the ordered compound output.</p>
<p>So, for example, if called with Age = 17, Risk category = &quot;HIGH&quot; and
Debt review = true, the Routing rules table in Figure 8-19 would return
the outputs of all four rules, in the order 2, 4, 3, 1.</p>

<p>Crosstab tables are unique and complete by definition and therefore do
not need a hit policy.</p>
<h4>Note 2  {#note-2 .unnumbered}</h4>
<p>The sequence of the rules in a decision table does not influence the
meaning, except in <strong>F</strong>irst tables (single hit) and <strong>R</strong>ule order
tables (multiple hit). These tables should be used with care.</p>

<h3>Decision Table metamodel</h3>
<p>The class DecisionTable is used to model a decision table.</p>
<p>DecisionTable is a concrete specialization of Expression.</p>
<p>An instance of DecisionTable contains a list of rules which are
instances of DecisionRule, a list of inputs which are instances of
InputClause, a list of outputs which are instances of OutputClause, and
a list of annotations which are instances of RuleAnnotationClause.</p>
<p>It has a preferredOrientation, which SHALL be one of the enumerated</p>
<p>DecisionTableOrientation: Rule-as-Row, Rule-as-Column or CrossTable. An
instance of DecisionTable SHOULD BE represented as specified by its
preferredOrientation, as defined in clause 8.2.2.</p>
<p>An instance of DecisionTable has an associated hitPolicy, which SHALL be
one of the enumerated HitPolicy: UNIQUE, FIRST, PRIORITY, ANY, COLLECT,
RULE ORDER, OUTPUT ORDER. The default value for the hitPolicy attribute
is: UNIQUE. In the diagrammatic representation of an instance of
DecisionTable, the hitPolicy is represented as specified in clause
8.2.10.</p>
<p>The semantics that is associated with an instance of DecisionTable
depends on its associated hitPolicy, as specified below and in clause
8.2.10. The hitPolicy attribute of an instance of DecisionTable is
represented as specified in clause 8.2.10.</p>
<p>If the hitPolicy associated with an instance of DecisionTable is FIRST
or RULE ORDER, the rules that are associated with the DecisionTable
SHALL be ordered. The ordering is represented by the explicit numbering
of the rules in the diagrammatic representation of the DecisionTable.</p>
<p>If the hitPolicy associated with an instance of DecisionTable is
PRIORITY or OUTPUT ORDER, the outputValue s determine the result as
specified in clause 8.2.10.</p>
<p>If the hitPolicy that is associated with an instance of DecisionTable is
COLLECT, the DecisionTable MAY have an associated aggregation, which is
one of the enumerated BuiltinAggregator (see clause 8.2.10).</p>
<p>As a kind of Expression, an instance of DecisionTable has a value, which
depends on the outputs of the associated rules, the associated hitPolicy
and the associated aggregration, if any. The value of an instance of
DecisionTable is determined according to the specification in clause
10.3.2.10.</p>
<p>DecisionTable inherits all the attributes and model associations from
Expression. Table 32 presents the additional attributes and model
associations of the DecisionTable element.</p>

<h3>Decision Table Input and Output metamodel</h3>
<p>In a DecisionTable, an input specifies an inputExpression (the subject)
and a number of inputEntries. An output specifies the name and the
domain of definition of an output value, a number of outputEntries.</p>
<p>The class InputClause is used to model a decision table input, and the
class OutputClause is used to model a decision table output, and the
class RuleAnnotationClause is used to model a decision table annotation.</p>
<p>An instance of InputClause is made of an optional inputExpression and an
ordered list of inputEntry, which are instances of UnaryTests. An
instance of OutputClause optionally references a typeRef, specifying its
datatype, and it is made of an ordered list of outputEntry, which are
instances of LiteralExpression, and an optional defaultOutputEntry,
which is also an instance of LiteralExpression. An instance of
RuleAnnotationClause contains a name of type String.</p>
<p>When a DecisionTable contains more than one OutputClause, each
OutputClause SHALL have a name. When a DecisionTable has a single
OutputClause, the OutputClause SHALL NOT have a name. A
RuleAnnotationClause SHALL have a name.</p>

<h3>Decision Rule metamodel</h3>
<p>The class DecisionRule is used to model the rules in a decision table
(see 8.2).</p>
<p>An instance of DecisionRule has an ordered list of inputEntry instances
which are instances of UnaryTests, an ordered list of outputEntry
instances, which are instances of LiteralExpression, and an ordered list
of ruleAnnotations.</p>
<p>In a tabular representation of the containing instance of DecisionTable,
the representation of an instance of</p>
<p>DecisonRule depends on the orientation of the decision table. For
instance, if the decision table is represented horizontally (rules as
row, see 8.2.2), instances of DecisionRule are represented as rows, with
all the inputEntrys represented on the left of all the outputEntrys, and
all the ruleAnnotations represented to their right.</p>
<p>By definition, a DecisionRule element that has no inputEntrys is always
applicable. Otherwise, an instance of DecisionRule is said to be
<em>applicable</em> if and only if, all of the DecisionTable's inputExpression
values satisfy their corresponding inputEntry.</p>
<p>The inputEntrys are matched in arbitrary order.</p>
<p>The inputEntry elements SHALL be in the same order as the containing
DecisionTable's inputs.</p>
<p>The <em>i^th^</em> inputExpression must satisfy the <em>i^th^</em> inputEntry for all
inputEntrys in order for the DecisionRule to <em>match</em>, as defined in
section 8.1.</p>
<p>The outputEntry elements SHALL be in the same order as the containing
DecisionTable's outputs. The <em>i^th^</em> outputEntry SHALL be consistent
with the typeRef of the <em>i^th^</em> OutputClause.</p>
<p>The ruleAnnotation elements SHALL be in the same order as the containing
DecisionTable's annotations. The <em>ith</em> ruleAnnotation refers to the
<em>i^th^</em> RuleAnnotationClause.</p>

<h1>Simple Expression Language (S-FEEL)</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>DMN</strong> defines the friendly enough expression language (FEEL) for the
purpose of giving standard executable semantics to many kinds of
expressions in decision model (see 10).</p>
<p>This section defines a simple subset of FEEL, S-FEEL, for the purpose of
giving standard executable semantics to decision models that use only
simple expressions: in particular, decision models where the decision
logic is modeled mostly or only using decision tables.</p>
<p>Experience with DMN since its release has shown that few if any complete
decision models can be defined using S- FEEL. Individual decision tables
can be defined using only S-FEEL but within a decision model there is
generally at least one decision that requires FEEL. Developers and users
are therefore encouraged to use and implement the full FEEL
specification rather than the S-FEEL subset.</p>
<h2>S-FEEL syntax</h2>
<p>The syntax for the S-FEEL expressions used in this section is specified
in the EBNF below: it is a subset of the FEEL syntax specified in clause

<h2>S-FEEL data types</h2>
<p>S-FEEL supports all FEEL data types: <em>number</em>, <em>string</em>, <em>boolean</em>,
<em>days and time duration</em>, <em>years and months duration</em>, <em>time,</em> and
<em>date</em>, although with a simplified definition for some of them.</p>
<p>S-FEEL <em>number</em> has the same literal and values spaces as the XML Schema
decimal datatype. Implementations are allowed to limit precision to 34
decimal digits and to round toward the nearest neighbor with ties
favoring the even neighbor. Notice that &quot;<em>precision is not reflected in
this value space: the number 2.0 is not distinct from the number 2.00</em>&quot;
[XML Schema]. Notice, also, that this value space is totally ordered.
The definition of S-FEEL <em>number</em> is a simplification over the
definition of FEEL <em>number</em>.</p>
<p>S-FEEL supports FEEL <em>string</em> and FEEL <em>Boolean</em>: FEEL <em>string</em> has the
same literal and values spaces as the Java String and XML Schema string
datatypes. FEEL <em>boolean</em> has the same literal and values spaces as the
Java Boolean and XML Schema Boolean datatypes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>S-FEEL supports the FEEL <em>time</em> data type. The lexical and value
spaces of FEEL <em>time</em> are the literal and value spaces of the XML
Schema time datatype. Notice that, &quot;<em>since the lexical representation
allows an optional time zone indicator, time values are partially
ordered because it may not be able to determine the order of two
values one of which has a time zone and the other does not. Pairs of
time values with or without time zone indicators are totally ordered</em>&quot;
[XSD].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>S-FEEL does not support FEEL date and time. However, it supports the
<em>date</em> type, which is like FEEL <em>date and time</em> with hour, minute, and
second required to be absent. The lexical and value spaces of FEEL
<em>date</em> are the literal and value spaces of the XML Schema date datatype.</p>
<p>S-FEEL supports the FEEL <em>days and time duration</em> and <em>years and months
duration</em> datatypes. FEEL <em>days and time duration</em> and <em>years and months
duration</em> have the same literal and value spaces as the XPath Data Model
dayTimeDuration and yearMonthDuration datatypes, respectively. That is,
FEEL <em>days and time duration</em> is derived from the XML Schema duration
datatype by restricting its lexical representation to contain only the
days, hours, minutes, and seconds components, and FEEL <em>years and months
duration</em> is derived from the XML Schema duration datatype by
restricting its lexical representation to contain only the year and
month components.</p>
<p>The FEEL data types are specified in detail in clause 10.3.2.2.</p>
<h2>S-FEEL semantics</h2>
<p>S-FEEL contains only a limited set of basic features that are common to
most expression and programming languages, and on the semantics of which
most expression and programming languages agree.</p>
<p>The semantics of S-FEEL expressions are defined in this section, in
terms of the semantics of the XML Schema datatypes and the XQuery 1.0
and XPath 2.0 Data Model datatypes, and in terms of the corresponding
functions and operators defined by XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Functions
and Operators (prefixed by &quot;op:&quot; below). A complete standalone
specification of the semantics is to be found in clause 10.3.2, as part
of the definition of FEEL. Within the scope of S- FEEL, the two
definitions are equivalent and equally normative.</p>
<p>Arithmetic addition and subtraction (grammar rule 2.a) have the same
semantics as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>op:numeric-add and op:numeric-subtract, when its two operands are
numbers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>op:add-yearMonthDurations and op:subtract-yearMonthDurations, when
the two operands are years and months durations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>op:add-dayTimeDuration and subtract:dayTimeDurations, when the two
operands are days and time durations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>op:add-yearMonthDuration-to-date and
op:subtract-yearMonthDuration-from-date, when the first operand is a
years and months duration and the second operand is a date;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>op:add-dayTimeDuration-to-date and
op:subtract-dayTimeDuration-from-date, when the first operand is a
days and time duration and the second operand is a date;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>op:add-dayTimeDuration-to-time and
op:subtract-dayTimeDuration-from-time, when the first operand is a
days and time duration and the second operand is a time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, arithmetic subtraction has the semantics of
op:subtract-dates or op:subtract-times, when the two operands are dates
or times, respectively.</p>
<p>Arithmetic addition and subtraction are not defined in other cases.</p>
<p>Arithmetic multiplication and division (grammar rule 2.b) have the same
semantics as defined for op:numeric-multiply and op:numeric-divide,
respectively, when the two operands are numbers. They are not defined
otherwise.</p>
<p>Arithmetic exponentiation (grammar rule 2.c) is defined as the result of
raising the first operand to the power of the second operand, when the
two operands are numbers. It is not defined in other cases.</p>
<p>Arithmetic negation (grammar rule 2.d) is defined only when its operand
is a number: in that case, its semantics is according to the
specification of op:numeric-unary-minus.</p>
<p>Comparison operators (grammar rule 35) between numbers are defined
according to the specification of op:numericequal, op-numeric-less-than
and op:numeric-greater-than, comparisons between dates are defined
according to the specification of op:date-equal, op:date-less-than and
op:date-greater-than; comparisons between times are defined according to
the specification of op:time-equal, op:time-less-than and
op:time-greater-than; comparisons between years and months durations are
defined according to the specification of op:duration-equal,</p>
<p>op:yearMonthDuration-less-than and op:year-MonthDuration-greater-than;
comparisons between days and time durations are defined according to the
specification of op:duration-equal, op:dayTimeDuration-less-than and
op:dayTimeDuration-greater-than.</p>
<p>String and Booleans can only be compared for equality: the semantics of
strings and Booleans equality is as defined in the specification of
fn:codepoint-equal and op:Boolean-equal, respectively.</p>
<p>Comparison operators are defined only when the two operands have the
same type, except for years and months duration and days and time
duration, which can be compared for equality. Notice, however, that
&quot;<em>with the exception of the zero- length duration, no instance of
xs:dayTimeDuration can ever be equal to an instance of
xs:yearMonthDuration</em>.&quot; [XFO].</p>
<p>Given an expression o to be tested and two endpoint e1 and e2:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>is in the interval (e1..e2), also notated ]e1..e2[, if and only if
o &gt; e1 and o &lt; e1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is in the interval (e1..e2], also notated ]e1..e2], if and only
if o &gt; e1 and o ≤ e2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is in the interval [e1..e2] if and only if o ≥ e1 and o ≤ e2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is in the interval [e1..e2), also notated [e1..e2[, if and only
if o ≥ e1 and o &lt; e2</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An expression to be tested satisfies an instance of simple unary tests
(grammar rule 12) if and only if, either the expression is a list and
the expression satisfies at least one simple unitary test in the list,
or the simple unitary tests is &quot;-&quot;.</p>
<h2>Use of S-FEEL expressions</h2>
<p>This section summarizes which kinds of S-FEEL expressions are allowed in
which role when the expression language is S-FEEL.</p>
<h3>Item definitions</h3>
<p>The expression that defines an <strong>allowed value</strong> SHALL be an instance of
<em>simple unary tests</em> (grammar rule 12), where only the values in the
defined or referenced type that satisfy the test are allowed values.</p>
<h3>Invocations</h3>
<p>In the bindings of an invocation, the <strong>binding formula</strong> SHALL be a
<em>simple expression</em> (grammar rule 3).</p>
<h3>Decision tables</h3>
<p>Each <strong>input expression</strong> SHALL be a <em>simple expression</em> (grammar rule
3).</p>
<p>Each list of <strong>input values</strong> SHALL be an instance of <em>simple unary
tests</em> (grammar rule 12).</p>
<p>Each list of <strong>output values</strong> SHALL be an instance of <em>simple unary
tests</em> (grammar rule 12). Each <strong>input entry</strong> SHALL be an instance of
<em>simple unary tests</em> (grammar rule 12).</p>
<p>Each <strong>output entry</strong> SHALL be a <em>simple expression</em> (grammar rule 3).</p>

<h1>Expression Language (FEEL)</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In <strong>DMN</strong>, all decision logic is represented as <em>boxed expressions</em>.
Clause 7.2 introduced the concept of the boxed expression and defined
two simple kinds: boxed literal expressions and boxed invocations.
Clause 8 defined decision tables, a very important kind of boxed
expression*.* This section completes the graphical notation for decision
logic, by defining other kinds of boxed expressions.</p>
<p>The expressions 'in the boxes' are FEEL expressions. FEEL stands for
Friendly Enough Expression Language and it has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Side-effect free</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple data model with numbers, dates, strings, lists, and contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple syntax designed for a wide audience</p>

<p>This section also completely specifies the syntax and semantics of FEEL.
The syntax is specified as a grammar (10.3.1). The subset of the syntax
intended to be rendered graphically as a boxed expression is also
specified as a meta-model (10.5).</p>
<p>FEEL has two roles in <strong>DMN</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As a textual notation in the boxes of boxed expressions such as
decision tables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a slightly larger language to represent the logic of expressions
and DRGs for the main purpose of composing the semantics in a simple
and uniform way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notation</h2>
<h3>Boxed Expressions</h3>
<p>This section builds on the generic notation for decision logic and boxed
expressions defined in clause 7.2.</p>
<p>We define a graphical notation for decision logic called <strong>boxed
expressions</strong>. This notation serves to decompose the decision logic
model into small pieces that can be associated with DRG artifacts. The
DRG plus the boxed expressions form a complete, mostly graphical
language that completely specifies Decision Models.</p>
<p>A boxed expression is either:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a decision table</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a boxed FEEL expression</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a boxed invocation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a boxed context</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a boxed list</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a relation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a boxed function</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a boxed conditional</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a boxed filter, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a boxed iterator</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Boxed expressions are defined recursively, <em>i.e.,</em> boxed expressions can
contain other boxed expressions. The toplevel boxed expression
corresponds to the decision logic of a single DRG artifact. This boxed
expression SHALL have a name box that contains the name of the DRG
artifact. The name box may be attached in a single box on top, as shown
in Figure 10-1:</p>

height=&quot;0.6777865266841645in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 10-1: Boxed expression</strong></p>
<p>Alternatively, the name box and expression box can be separated by white
space and connected on the left side with a line, as shown in Figure 10-
2:</p>
<p><img src="media/image92.jpg" alt="A picture containing table Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;2.1310411198600177in&quot;
height=&quot;1.1180555555555556in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 10- 2: Boxed expression with separated name and expression
boxes</strong></p>
<p>Graphical tools are expected to support appropriate graphical links, for
example, clicking on a decision shape opens a decision table.</p>
<h4>Decision Tables</h4>
<p>The executable decision tables defined here use the same notation as the
decision tables defined in Clause 8. Their execution semantics is
defined in clause 10.3.2.10.</p>
<h4>Boxed FEEL expression</h4>
<p>A <strong>boxed FEEL expression</strong> is any FEEL expression <em>e,</em> as defined by
the FEEL grammar (clause 10.3.1), in a table cell, as shown in Figure
10-3:</p>
<p><img src="media/image93.jpg" alt="A picture containing diagram Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;0.5557600612423447in&quot;
height=&quot;0.5138943569553805in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 10-3: Boxed FEEL expression</strong></p>
<p>The meaning of a boxed expression containing <em>e</em> is **FEEL(**<em>e,</em>
<strong>s)</strong>, where <strong>s</strong> is the scope. The scope includes the context derived
from the containing DRD as described in 10.4, and any boxed contexts
containing <em>e</em>.</p>
<p>It is usually good practice to make <em>e</em> relatively simple and compose
small boxed expressions into larger boxed expressions.</p>
<h4>Boxed Invocation</h4>
<p>The syntax for boxed invocation is described in clause 7.2.3. This
syntax may be used to invoke any function (e.g., business knowledge
model, FEEL built-in function, boxed function definition).</p>
<p>The box labeled 'invoked business knowledge model' can be any boxed
expression whose value is a function, as shown in<br />

Figure 10-4: Boxed invocation</strong></p>
<p>The boxed syntax maps to the textual syntax defined by grammar rules 38,
39, 40, 41. Boxed invocation uses named parameters. Positional
invocation can be achieved using a boxed expression containing a textual
positional invocation.</p>
<p>The boxed syntax requires at least one parameter. A parameterless
function must be invoked using the textual syntax, e.g., as shown in
Figure 10-5.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>function-valued expression()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>**<br />
**<strong>Figure 10-5: Parameterless function</strong></p>
<p>Formally, the meaning of a boxed invocation is given by the semantics of
the equivalent textual invocation, <em>e.g.,</em> <strong>function-valued expression
(parameter1: binding expression1,</strong> parameter2**: binding
expression2, ...)**.</p>
<h4>Boxed Context</h4>
<p>A <strong>boxed context</strong> is a collection of <em>n</em> (name, value) pairs with an
optional result value. The names SHALL be distinct within a context.
Each pair is called a context entry. Context entries may be separated by
whitespace and connected with a line on the left (top). The intent is
that all the entries of a context should be easily identified by looking
down the left edge of a vertical context or across the top edge of a
horizontal context. Cells SHALL be arranged in one of the following ways
(see Figure 10-6, Figure 10-7):</p>
<p>+---------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| &gt; Name 1                        | &gt; Value 1                          |

<p>The context entries in a context are often used to decompose a complex
expression into simpler expressions, each with a name. These context
entries may be thought of as intermediate results. For example, contexts
without a final Result box are useful for representing case data (see
Figure 10-8).</p>

<p><strong>Figure 10-9: Use of final result box</strong></p>
<p>When decision tables are (non-result) context entries, the output cell
can be used to name the entry, thus saving space. Any format decision
table can be used in a vertical context. A jagged right edge is allowed.
Whitespace between context entries may be helpful. See Figure 10-10.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 10-10: Vertical context with decision table entry</strong></p>
<p>Color is suggested. The names SHALL be legal FEEL names. The values and
optional result are boxed expressions.</p>
<p>Boxed contexts may have a decision table as the result and use the named
context entries to compute the inputs and give them names. For example
(see Figure 10-11):</p>

<p>: <strong>Table 54: Specific semantics of inequality</strong></p>
<p><strong>Figure 10-11: Use of boxed expressions with a decision table</strong></p>
<p>Formally, the meaning of a boxed context is { &quot;Name 1&quot;: Value 1, &quot;Name
2&quot;: Value 2, ..., &quot;Name <em>n&quot;</em>: Value <em>n</em> } if no Result is specified.
Otherwise, the meaning is { &quot;Name 1&quot;: Value 1, &quot;Name 2&quot;: Value 2, ...,
&quot;Name <em>n&quot;</em>: Value <em>n</em>, &quot;result&quot;: Result }.result. Recall that the bold
face indicates elements in the FEEL Semantic Domain. The scope includes
the context derived from the containing DRG as described in 10.4.</p>
<p>Boxed context entries for contexts that do not have a result box are
accessible outside the context (as QNs), subject to the scope rules
defined in clause 10.3.2.11. Boxed context entries for contexts that
have a result box are not accessible outside the context.</p>
<h4>Boxed List</h4>
<p>A <strong>boxed list</strong> is a list of <em>n</em> items. Cells SHALL be arranged in one
of the following ways (see Figure 10-12, Figure 10-13):</p>
<p><img src="media/image94.jpg" alt="Table Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;1.5139107611548557in&quot;
height=&quot;1.2847003499562555in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 10-12: Vertical list</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Item 1**,** Item 2**,** Item <em>n</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Figure 10-13: Horizontal list</strong></p>
<p>Line styles are normative. The items are boxed expressions. Formally,
the meaning of a boxed list is just the meaning of the list, i.e., <strong>[
Item 1, Item 2, ..., Item <em>n</em> ]</strong>. The scope includes the context
derived from the containing DRG as described in 10.4.</p>
<h4>Relation</h4>
<p>A vertical list of homogeneous horizontal contexts (with no result
cells) can be displayed with the names appearing just once at the top of
the list, like a relational table, as shown in Figure 10-14:</p>
<p>+---------------------+---------------------+--------------------------+
| &gt; Name 1            | &gt; Name 2            | Name <em>n</em>                 |
+=====================+=====================+==========================+

+---------------------+---------------------+--------------------------+
| &gt; Value 1b          | &gt; Value 2b          | &gt; Value <em>n</em>b             |

<h4>Boxed Function</h4>
<p>A Boxed Function Definition is the notation for parameterized boxed
expressions.</p>
<p>The boxed expression associated with a Business Knowledge Model SHALL be
a boxed function definition or a decision table whose input expressions
are assumed to be the parameter names.</p>
<p>A boxed function has 3 cells:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Kind</strong>, containing the initial letter of one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>F</strong>EEL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P</strong>MML</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>J</strong>ava</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>Kind</strong> box can be omitted for FEEL functions, including decision
tables.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Parameters: 0 or more comma-separated names, in parentheses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Body: a boxed expression</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The 3 cells SHALL be arranged as shown in Figure 10-15:</p>
<p>+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| K       | (Parameter1, Parameter2, ...)                              |
+=========+============================================================+
|         | &gt; Body                                                     |
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+</p>
<p>: <strong>Table 56: General semantics of addition and subtraction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Figure 10-15: Boxed function definition</strong></p>
<p>For FEEL functions, denoted by <strong>Kind</strong> FEEL or by omission of <strong>Kind</strong>,
the Body SHALL be a FEEL expression that references the parameters. For
externally defined functions denoted by Kind Java, the Body SHALL be a
context as described in 10.3.2.13.3 and the form of the mapping
information SHALL be the <em>java</em> form. For externally defined functions
denoted by <strong>Kind</strong> PMML, the Body SHALL be a context as described in
10.3.2.13.3 and the form of the mapping information SHALL be the <em>pmml</em>
form.</p>
<p>Formally, the meaning of a boxed function is just the meaning of the
function, <em>i.e.</em>, FEEL(<em>funcion(Parameter1, Parameter2, ...) Body</em>) if
the <strong>Kind</strong> is FEEL, and FEEL(<em>funcion(Parameter1, Parameter2, ...)
external Body</em>) otherwise. The scope includes the context derived from
the containing DRG as described in 10.4.</p>
<h4>Boxed conditional</h4>
<p>Boxed conditional offers a visual representation of an <strong>if</strong> statement
using three rows. The first one is labelled &quot;if&quot;; the second one is
labelled &quot;then&quot; and the last one is labelled &quot;else&quot;. In the right part,
another FEEL expression is expected. The expression in the &quot;if&quot; part
MUST resolve to a boolean.</p>

<h4>Boxed filter</h4>
<p>Boxed filter offers a visual representation of collection filtering. The
top part is an expression that is the collection to be filtered. The
bottom part, between the square brackets, holds the filter expression.
The expression in the top part MUST resolve to a collection. The
expression in the bottom part MUST resolve to a Boolean.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 10-19: Use of filter expression with a list expression</strong></p>
<h4>Boxed iterator</h4>
<p>Boxed iterator offers a visual representation of an iterator statement.
There are three flavors to it: <strong>for</strong> loop and quantified expression
<strong>some</strong> and <strong>every</strong>.</p>
<p>For the <strong>for</strong> loop, the three rows are labelled &quot;for&quot;, &quot;in&quot; and
&quot;return&quot;. The right part of the &quot;for&quot; displays the iterator variable
name. The second row holds an expression representing the collection
that will be iterated over. The expression in the in row MUST resolve to
a collection. The last row contains the expression that will process
each element of the collection.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 10-21: Use of for expression that returns a context</strong></p>
<p><strong>Every</strong> and <strong>some</strong> expression have a similar structure. The only
difference between the two is the caption on the first line which is
&quot;every&quot; or &quot;some&quot;. The second line is labelled &quot;in&quot; and the last one
&quot;satisfies&quot;. The right part of the first line is the iterator variable
name. The expression defined in the second row is the collection that
will be tested. The expression in the in row MUST resolve to a
collection. The last line is an expression that will be evaluated on
each item. The expression defined in the satisfies MUST resolve to a
boolean.</p>

<h3>FEEL</h3>
<p>A subset of FEEL, defined in the next section, serves as the notation
&quot;in the boxes&quot; of boxed expressions. A FEEL object is a number, a
string, a date, a time, a duration, a function, a context, or a list of
FEEL objects (including nested lists).</p>
<p>Note: A JSON object is a number, a string, a context (JSON calls them
maps) or a list of JSON objects. So, FEEL is an extension of JSON in
this regard. In addition, FEEL provides friendlier syntax for literal
values, and does not require context keys to be quoted.</p>
<p>Here we give a &quot;feel&quot; for the language by starting with some simple
examples.</p>
<h4>Comparison of ranges</h4>
<p>Ranges and lists of ranges appear in decision table input entry, input
value, and output value cells. In the examples in Table 39, this portion
of the syntax is shown underlined. Strings, dates, times, and durations
also may be compared, using typographical literals defined in section
7.2.2.1.</p>

<p>: <strong>Table 59: Specific semantics of multiplication and division</strong></p>
<h2>Full FEEL Syntax and Semantics</h2>
<p>Clause 9 introduced a subset of FEEL sufficient to support decision
tables for Conformance Level 2 (see clause 2). The full <strong>DMN</strong>
friendly-enough expression language (FEEL) required for Conformance
Level 3 is specified here.</p>
<p>FEEL is a simple language with inspiration drawn from Java, JavaScript,
XPath, SQL, PMML, Lisp, and many others.</p>
<p>The syntax is defined using grammar rules that show how complex
expressions are composed of simpler expressions. Likewise, the semantic
rules show how the meaning of a complex expression is composed from the
meaning of constituent simper expressions.</p>
<p><strong>DMN</strong> completely defines the meaning of FEEL expressions that do not
invoke externally-defined functions. There are no implementation-defined
semantics. FEEL expressions (that do not invoke externally-defined
functions) have no side- effects and have the same interpretation in
every conformant implementation. Externally-defined functions SHOULD be
deterministic and side-effect free.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>FEEL syntax is defined as grammar here and equivalently as a UML Class
diagram in the meta-model (10.5)</p>
<h4>Grammar notation</h4>
<p>The grammar rules use the ISO EBNF notation. Each rule defines a
non-terminal symbol <em>S</em> in terms of some other symbols <em>S1, S2, ...</em>
The following table summarizes the EBNF notation.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Example</strong>                         <strong>Meaning</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><em>S = S1 ;</em>                          Symbol <em>S</em> is defined in terms of
symbol <em>S1</em></p>
<p><em>S1 | S2</em>                          Either <em>S1</em> or <em>S2</em></p>
<p><em>S1, S2</em>                            <em>S1</em> followed by <em>S2</em></p>
<p><em>[S1]</em>                            <em>S1</em> occurring 0 or 1 time</p>
<p><em>{S1}</em>                              <em>S1</em> repeated 0 or more times</p>
<p><em>k * S1</em>                           <em>S1</em> repeated k times</p>
<h2>&quot;and&quot;                             literal terminal symbol</h2>
<p>: <strong>Table 60: Semantics of exponentiation</strong></p>
<p>We extend the ISO notation with character ranges for brevity, as
follows:</p>
<p>A character range has the following EBNF syntax:</p>
<p>character range = &quot;[&quot;, low character, &quot;-&quot;, high character, &quot;]&quot; ;
low character = unicode character ; high character = unicode character ;
unicode character = simple character | code point ; code point =
&quot;\u&quot;, 4 * hexadecimal digit | &quot;\U&quot;, 6 * hexadecimal digit;
hexadecimal digit = &quot;0&quot; | &quot;1&quot; | &quot;2&quot; | &quot;3&quot; | &quot;4&quot; | &quot;5&quot;
| &quot;6&quot; | &quot;7&quot; | &quot;8&quot; | &quot;9&quot; |</p>
<p>&quot;a&quot; | &quot;A&quot; | &quot;b&quot; | &quot;B&quot; | &quot;c&quot; | &quot;C&quot; | &quot;d&quot; | &quot;D&quot; |
&quot;e&quot; | &quot;E&quot; | &quot;f&quot; | &quot;F&quot; ;</p>
<p>A simple character is a single Unicode character, <em>e.g.,</em> a, 1, $,
<em>etc.</em> Alternatively, a character may be specified by its hexadecimal
code point value, prefixed with <em>\u</em>.</p>
<p>Every Unicode character has a numeric code point value. The low
character in a range must have numeric value less than the numeric value
of the high character.</p>
<p>For example, hexadecimal digit can be described more succinctly using
character ranges as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hexadecimal digit = [0-9] | [a-i | [A-F] ;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the character range that includes all Unicode characters is
<em>[\u0-\u10FFFF]</em>.</p>

<p>Additional syntax rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Operator precedence is given by the order of the alternatives in
grammar rules 1, 2 and 4, in order from lowest to highest. <em>E.g.,</em>
(boxed) invocation has higher precedence than multiplication,
multiplication has higher precedence than addition, and addition has
higher precedence than comparison. Addition and subtraction have
equal precedence, and like all FEEL infix binary operators, are left
associative. Note that FEEL's order of operations regarding
arithmetic negation and exponentiation differs from standard
mathematical precedence, e.g. the FEEL expression -4 ** 2 is
interpreted as (-4)*(-4) and evaluates to 16. In standard
mathematics, -4 ** 2 is interpreted as -(4*4) and evaluates to
-16 instead. To avoid any ambiguity, users are recommend to use
explicit parentheses, e.g. instead of -4 ** 2 specify -(4 ** 2)
= -16 or (-4) ** 2 = 16 as appropriate. Tools MAY present a
warning to users to inform about the potentially unexpected
precedence of the combination of these two operators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Java-style comments can be used, <em>i.e.</em> '//' to end of line and
/* ... */.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In rule 60 (&quot;date time literal&quot;), for the &quot;function invocation&quot;
alternative, the only permitted functions are the builtins <em>date</em>,
<em>time</em>, <em>date and time</em>, and <em>duration</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The string in rule 65 must follow the date string, time string, date
and time string or duration string syntax, as detailed in section
10.3.4.1.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Literals, data types, built-in functions</h4>
<p>FEEL supports literal syntax for numbers, strings, booleans, date, time,
date and time, duration, and <em>null</em>. (See grammar rules, clause
10.3.1.2). Literals can be mapped directly to values in the FEEL
semantic domain (clause 10.3.2.1).</p>
<p>FEEL supports the following datatypes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>String</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boolean</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>days and time duration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>years and months duration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>date</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>date and time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>list</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>range</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>context</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>function</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tokens, Names and White space</h4>
<p>A FEEL expression consists of a sequence of tokens, possibly separated
with white space (grammar rule 63). A token is a sequence of Unicode
characters, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A literal terminal symbol in any grammar rule other than grammar
rule 30. Literal terminal symbols are enclosed in double quotes in
the grammar rules, e.g., &quot;and&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;=&quot;, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sequence conforming to grammar rule 28, 29, 35, or 37</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For backward compatibility reasons, &quot;list&quot;, &quot;context&quot; and &quot;range&quot; from
grammar rule 52 are not considered literal terminal symbols.</p>
<p>White space (except inside strings) acts as token separators. Most
grammar rules act on tokens, and thus ignore white space (which is not a
token).</p>
<p>A name (grammar rule 27) is defined as a sequence of tokens. I.e., the
name IncomeTaxesAmount is defined as the list of tokens <strong>[ Income,
Taxes, Amount ]</strong>. The name Income+Expenses is defined as the list of
tokens <strong>[ Income, + , Expenses ]</strong>. A consequence of this is that a
name like Phone Number with one space in between the tokens is the same
as Phone Number with several spaces in between the tokens.</p>
<p>A name start (grammar rule 26) SHALL NOT be a literal terminal symbol.</p>
<p>A name part (grammar rule 27) MAY be a literal terminal symbol.</p>
<h4>Contexts, Lists, Qualified Names, and Context Lists</h4>
<p>A context is a map of key-value pairs called context entries and is
written using curly braces to delimit the context, commas to separate
the entries, and a colon to separate key and value (grammar rule 57).
The key can be a string or a name. The value is an expression.</p>
<p>A list is written using square brackets to delimit the list, and commas
to separate the list items (grammar rule 54).</p>
<p>Contexts and lists can reference other contexts and lists, giving rise
to a directed acyclic graph. Naming is path based. The <em>qualified name</em>
(QN) of a context entry is of the form <em>N1</em>.<em>N2 ... N~n~</em> where <em>N1</em> is
the name of an in-scope context.</p>
<p>Nested lists encountered in the interpretation of <em>N1</em>.<em>N2 ... N~n~</em>
are preserved. <em>E.g.,</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[{a: {b: [1]}}, {a: {b: [2.1, 2.2]}}, {a: {b: [3]}}, {a: {b:
[4, 5]}}].a.b =</em></p>
<p><em>[{b: [1]}, {b: [2.1,2.2]}, {b: [3]}, {b: [4, 5]}].b =</em></p>
<p><em>[[1], [2.1, 2.2], [3], [4, 5]]</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nested lists can be flattened using the <em>flatten()</em> built-in function
(10.3.4).</p>
<h4>Ambiguity</h4>
<p>FEEL expressions reference InformationItems by their qualified name
(QN), in which name parts are separated by a period. For example,
variables containing components are referenced as
[varName].[componentName]. Imported elements such as
InformationItems and ItemDefinitions are referenced by
namespace-qualified name, in which the first name part is the name
specified by the Import element importing the element. For example, an
imported variable containing components is referenced as [import
name].[varName].[componentName].</p>
<p>Because names are a sequence of tokens, and some of those tokens can be
FEEL operators and keywords, context is required to resolve ambiguity.
For example, the following could be names or other expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a-b</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a -- b</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what if?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Profit and loss</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ambiguity is resolved using the scope. Name tokens are matched from left
to right against the names in-scope, and the longest match is preferred.
In the case where the longest match is not desired, parenthesis or other
punctuation (that is not allowed in a name) can be used to disambiguate
a FEEL expression. For example, to subtract b from a if a-b is the name
of an in-scope context entry, one could write (a)-(b). Notice that it
does not help to write a - b, using space to separate the tokens,
because the space is not part of the token sequence and thus not part of
the name.</p>
<h3>Semantics</h3>
<p>FEEL semantics is specified by mapping syntax -fragments to values in
the FEEL semantic domain. Literals (clause 10.3.1.3) can be mapped
directly. Expressions composed of literals are mapped to values in the
semantic domain using simple logical and arithmetic operations on the
mapped literal values. In general, the semantics of any FEEL expression
are composed from the semantics of its sub-expressions.</p>
<h4>Semantic Domain</h4>
<p>The FEEL semantic domain <strong>D</strong> consists of an infinite number of typed
values. The types are organized into a lattice called <strong>L</strong>.</p>
<p>The types include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>simple datatypes such as number, boolean, string, date, time, and
duration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>constructed datatypes such as functions, lists, and contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Null type, which includes only the <strong>null</strong> value</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the special type Any, which includes all values in <strong>D</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A function is a lambda expression with lexical closure or is externally
defined by Java or PMML. A list is an ordered collection of domain
elements, and a context is a partially ordered collection of (string,
value) pairs called context entries.</p>
<p>We use <em>italics</em> to denote syntactic elements and <strong>boldface</strong> to denote
semantic elements. For example, FEEL**(<em><strong>[1+ 1, 2+2]</strong></em>) is [2,
4]**</p>
<p>Note that we use bold <strong>[]</strong> to denote a list in the FEEL semantic
domain, and bold numbers <strong>2, 4</strong> to denote those decimal values in the
FEEL semantic domain.</p>
<h4>Equality, Identity and Equivalence</h4>
<p>The semantics of equality are specified in the semantic mappings in
clause 10.3.2.15. In general, the values to be compared must be of the
same kind, for example, both numbers, to obtain a non-null result.</p>
<p>Identity simply compares whether two objects in the semantic domain are
the same object. We denote the test for identity using infix <strong>is</strong>, and
its negation using infix <strong>is not</strong>. For example, FEEL( <em>&quot;1&quot; = 1</em>)
<strong>is null</strong>. Note that <strong>is</strong> never results in <strong>null</strong>.</p>
<p>Every FEEL expression <em>e</em> in scope s can be mapped to an element <strong>e</strong>
in the FEEL semantic domain. This mapping defines the meaning of <em>e</em> in
s. The mapping may be written <strong>e is</strong> FEEL(<em>e</em>,s). Two FEEL expressions
<em>e~1~</em> and <em>e~2~</em> are equivalent in scope s if and only if
FEEL(<em>e~1~</em>,s) <strong>is</strong> FEEL(<em>e~2~</em>,s). When s is understood from context
(or not important), we may abbreviate the equivalence as <strong>e~1~ is
e~2~</strong>.</p>
<h4>Semantics of literals and datatypes</h4>
<p>FEEL datatypes are described in the following sub-sections. The meaning
of the datatypes includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A mapping from a literal form (which in some cases is a string) to a
value in the semantic domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A precise definition of the set of semantic domain values belonging
to the datatype, and the operations on them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each datatype describes a (possibly infinite) set of values. The sets
for the datatypes defined below are disjoint. We use <em>italics</em> to
indicate a literal and <strong>boldface</strong> to indicate a value in the semantic
domain.</p>
<h5>number</h5>
<p>FEEL Numbers are based on IEEE 754-2008 Decimal128 format, with 34
decimal digits of precision and rounding toward the nearest neighbor
with ties favoring the even neighbor. Numbers are a restriction of the
XML Schema type precisionDecimal, and are equivalent to Java BigDecimal
with MathContext DECIMAL 128.</p>
<p>Grammar rule 35 defines literal numbers. Literals consist of base 10
digits, an optional decimal point and an optional exponent. --INF, +INF,
and NaN literals are not supported. There is no distinction between -0
and 0. The number(from, grouping separator, decimal separator) built-in
function supports a richer literal format. E.g., FEEL(number(&quot;1.
000.000,01 &quot;, &quot;. &quot;, &quot;,&quot;)) = <strong>1000000.01</strong>.</p>
<p>FEEL supports literal scientific notation, e.g., 1.2e3, which is
equivalent to 1.2*10**3.</p>
<p>A FEEL number is represented in the semantic domain as a pair of
integers <strong>(p,s)</strong> such that <strong>p</strong> is a signed 34 digit integer carrying
the precision information, and <strong>s</strong> is the scale, in the range [−611
1..6176]. Each such pair represents the number <strong>p</strong>/10**^s^**. To
indicate the numeric value, we write <strong>value(p,s)</strong>. <em>E.g.</em>
<strong>value(100,2) = 1.</strong> If precision is not of concern, we may write the
value as simply <strong>1</strong>. Note that many different pairs have the same
value. For example, <strong>value(1,0) = value(10,1) = value(100,2)</strong>.</p>
<p>There is no value for notANumber, positiveInfinity, or negativeInfinity.
Use <strong>null</strong> instead.</p>
<h5>string</h5>
<p>Grammar rule 33 defines literal strings as a double-quoted sequence of
Unicode characters (see</p>
<p><a href="https://unicode.org/glossary/#character">[https://unicode.org/glossary/#character),]{.underline}</a>,)
e.g., &quot;abc&quot;. The supported Unicode character range is
[\u0-\u10FFFF]. The string literals are described by rule 33. The
corresponding Unicode code points are used to encode a string literal.</p>
<p>The literal string <em>&quot;abc&quot;</em> is mapped to the semantic domain as a
sequence of three Unicode characters <strong>a</strong>, <strong>b</strong>, and <strong>c</strong>, written
<strong>&quot;abc&quot;</strong>. The literal <em>&quot;\ U01F4 0E&quot;</em> is mapped to a sequence of
one Unicode character written <strong>&quot;ὀ&quot;</strong> corresponding to the code point
U+1F40E. <img src="media/image105.png" alt="" />{width=&quot;7.0e-2in&quot; height=&quot;0.12in&quot;}</p>
<h5>boolean</h5>
<p>The Boolean literals are given by grammar rule 34. The values in the
semantic domain are <strong>true</strong> and <strong>false</strong>.</p>
<h5>time</h5>
<p>Times in FEEL can be expressed using either a time literal (see grammar
rule 65) or the <em>time()</em> built-in function (See 10.3.4.1). We use
boldface time literals to represent values in the semantic domain.</p>
<p>A time in the semantic domain is a value of the XML Schema time
datatype. It can be represented by a sequence of numbers for the hour,
minute, second, and an optional time offset from Universal Coordinated
Time (UTC). If a time offset is specified, including time offset =
00:00, the time value has a UTC form and is comparable to all time
values that have UTC forms. If no time offset is specified, the time is
interpreted as a local time of day at some location, whose relationship
to UTC time is dependent on time zone rules for that location and may
vary from day to day. A local time of day value is only sometimes
comparable to UTC time values, as described in XML Schema Part 2
Datatypes.</p>
<p>A time <strong>t</strong> can also be represented as the number of seconds since
midnight. We write this as <strong>valuet(t)</strong>. <em>E.g.,</em> <strong>valuet(01:01:01) =
3661</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>valuet</strong> function is one-to-one, but its range is restricted to
[0..86400]. So, it has an inverse function <strong>valuet ^-1^</strong>(x) that
returns: the corresponding time value for x, if x is in [0..86400];
and <strong>valuet ^-1^</strong>(y), where y = x -- floor(x/86400) * 86400, if x is
not in [0..86400].</p>
<p>Note: That is, <strong>valuet ^-1^</strong>(x) is always actually applied to x modulo
86400. For example, <strong>valuet ^-1^</strong>(3600) will return the time of day
that is &quot;01:00:00&quot;, <strong>valuet ^-1^</strong>(90000) will also return &quot;T01
:00:00&quot;, and <strong>valuet ^-1^</strong>(-3600) will return the time of day that is
&quot;23 :00:00&quot;, treating -3600 seconds as one hour <em>before</em> midnight.</p>
<h5>date</h5>
<p>Dates in FEEL can be expressed using either a date literal (see grammar
rule 65) or the date() built-in function (See 10.3.4.1). A date in the
semantic domain is a sequence of numbers for the year, month, day of the
month. The year must be in the range [-999,999,999. .999,999,999]. We
use boldface date literals to represent values in the semantic domain.</p>
<p>When a date value is subject to implicit conversions (10.3.2.9.4) it is
considered to be equivalent to a date time<br />
value in which the time of day is UTC midnight (00:00:00).</p>
<h5>date-time</h5>
<p><em>Date and time</em> in FEEL can be expressed using either a <em>date time
literal</em> (see grammar rule 65) or the <em>date and time()</em> built-in
function (See 10.3.2.3.6). We use boldface <em>date and time literals</em> to
represent values in the semantic domain.</p>
<p>A date and time in the semantic domain is a sequence of numbers for the
year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and optional time offset from
Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). The year must be in the range [-</p>
<p>999,999,999..999,999,999]. If there is an associated time offset,
including 00:00, the date-time value has a UTC form and is comparable to
all other date-time values that have UTC forms. If there is no
associated time offset, the time is taken to be a local time of day at
some location, according to the time zone rules for that location. When
the time zone is specified, e.g., using the IANA tz form (see 10.3.4.1),
the date-time value may be converted to a UTC form using the time zone
rules for that location, if applicable.</p>
<p>Note: projecting timezone rules into the future may only be safe for
near-term date-time values.</p>
<p>A date and time <strong>d</strong> that has a UTC form can be represented as a number
of seconds since a reference date and time (called the epoch). We write
<strong>valuedt(d)</strong> to represent the number of seconds between <strong>d</strong> and the
epoch. The <strong>valuedt</strong> function is one- to-one and so it has an inverse
function <strong>valuedt ^-1^</strong>. <em>E.g.,</em> <strong>valuedt^-1^(valuedt(d)) = d.
valuedt ^-1^</strong> returns <strong>null</strong> rather than a date with a year outside
the legal range.</p>
<h5>days and time duration</h5>
<p>Days and time durations in FEEL can be expressed using either a duration
literal (see grammar rule 65) or the duration() builtin function (See
10.3.4.1). We use boldface days and time duration literals to represent
values in the semantic domain. The literal format of the characters
within the quotes of the string literal is defined by the lexical space
of the XPath Data Model dayTimeDuration datatype. A days and time
duration in the semantic domain is a sequence of numbers for the days,
hours, minutes, and seconds of duration, normalized such that the sum of
these numbers is minimized. For example, FEEL(<em>duration(&quot;P0DT25H&quot;)</em>) =
<strong>P1DT1H</strong>.</p>
<p>The value of a days and time duration can be expressed as a number of
seconds. <em>E.g.</em>, <strong>valuedtd(P1DT1H) = 90000.</strong> The <strong>valuedtd</strong> function
is one-to-one and so it has an inverse function <strong>valuedtd ~-1~</strong>.
<em>E.g.,</em> <strong>valuedtd ^-1^(90000) = P1DT1H.</strong></p>
<h5>years and months duration</h5>
<p>Years and months durations in FEEL can be expressed using either a
duration literal (see grammar rule 65) or the duration() built-in
function (See 10.3.4.1). We use boldface years and month duration
literals to represent values in the semantic domain. The literal format
of the characters within the quotes of the string literal is defined by
the lexical space of the XPath Data Model yearMonthDuration datatype. A
years and months duration in the semantic domain is a pair of numbers
for the years and months of duration, normalized such that the sum of
these numbers is minimized. For example, FEEL(<em>duration(&quot;P0Y13M&quot;)</em>) =
<strong>P1Y1M</strong>.</p>
<p>The value of a years and months duration can be expressed as a number of
months. <em>E.g.</em>, <strong>value~ymd~(P1Y1M) = 13.</strong> The <strong>valueymd</strong> function is
one-to-one and so it has an inverse function <strong>valueymd ~-1~</strong>. <em>E.g.,</em>
<strong>valueymd ^-1^(13) = P1Y1M.</strong></p>
<h4>Ternary logic</h4>
<p>FEEL, like SQL and PMML, uses of ternary logic for truth values. This
makes <strong>and</strong> and <strong>or</strong> complete functions from <em><strong>D</strong> x <strong>D</strong> →
<strong>D</strong></em>. Ternary logic is used in Predictive Modeling Markup Language to
model missing data values.</p>
<h4>Lists and filters</h4>
<p>Lists are immutable and may be nested. The <em>first</em> element of a list <em>L</em>
can be accessed using <em>L[1]</em> and the <em>last</em> element can be accessed
using <em>L[-1]</em>. The <em>n^th^</em> element from the beginning can be accessed
using <em>L[n],</em> and the <em>n^th^</em> element from the end can be accessed
using <em>L[-n]</em>.</p>
<p>If FEEL(<em>L</em>) = <strong>L</strong> is a list in the FEEL semantic domain, the first
element is FEEL(<em>L[1]</em>) = <strong>L[1]</strong>. If <strong>L</strong> does not contain <strong>n</strong>
items, then <strong>L[n] is null</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>L</strong> can be filtered with a Boolean expression in square brackets. The
expression in square brackets can reference a list element using the
name <em>item</em>, unless the list element is a context that contains the key
<strong>&quot;item&quot;</strong>. If the list element is a context, then its context entries
may be referenced within the filter expression without the <em>'item.'</em>
prefix. For example: <em>[1, 2, 3, 4][item &gt; 2] = [3, 4]</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[ {x:1, y:2}, {x:2, y:3} ][x=1] = [{x:1, y:2}]</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The filter expression is evaluated for each item in list, and a list
containing only items where the filter expression is <strong>true</strong> is
returned. E.g:</p>
<p>[ {x:1, y:2}, {x:null, y:3} ][x &lt; 2] = [{x:1, y:2}]</p>
<p>The expression to be filtered is subject to implicit conversions
(10.3.2.9.4) before the entire expression is evaluated.</p>
<p>For convenience, a selection using the &quot;.&quot; operator with a list of
contexts on its left hand side returns a list of selections, <em>i.e.</em>
FEEL(<em>e.f,</em> <strong>c</strong>) = <strong>[</strong> FEEL(<em>f</em>, <strong>c'</strong>)<strong>,</strong> FEEL(<em>f</em>,
<strong>c&quot;</strong>)<strong>, ... ]</strong> where FEEL(<em>e</em>) = <strong>[ e', e&quot;, ... ]</strong> and
<strong>c'</strong> is <strong>c</strong> augmented with the context entries of <strong>e'</strong>, <strong>c&quot;</strong>
is <strong>c</strong> augmented with the context entries of <strong>e&quot;</strong>, etc. For
example,</p>
<p><em>[ {x:1, y:2}, {x:2, y:3} ].y = [2,3]</em></p>
<p><em>[ {x:1, y:2}, {x:2} ].y = [ 2, null ]</em></p>
<h4>Context</h4>
<p>A FEEL context is a partially ordered collection of (key, expression)
pairs called context entries. In the syntax, keys can be either names or
strings. Keys are mapped to strings in the semantic domain. These
strings are distinct within a context. A context in the domain is
denoted using bold FEEL syntax with string keys, <em>e.g.</em> <strong>{ &quot;key1&quot; :
expr1, &quot;key2&quot; : expr2, ... }</strong>.</p>
<p>The syntax for selecting the value of the entry named <em>key1</em> from
context-valued expression <em>m</em> is <em>m.key1.</em></p>
<p>If <em>key1</em> is not a legal name or for whatever reason one wishes to treat
the key as a string, the following syntax is allowed: <em>get value(m,
&quot;key1 &quot;).</em> Selecting a value by key from context <strong>m</strong> in the semantic
domain is denoted as <strong>m.key1</strong> or <strong>get value(m, &quot;key1&quot;)</strong></p>
<p>To retrieve a list of key, value pairs from a context <em>m</em>, the following
built-in function may be used*: get entries(m).* For example, the
following is true: <em>get entries({key1: &quot;value1 &quot;})[key= &quot;key1
&quot;].value = &quot;value1&quot;</em></p>
<p>An expression in a context entry may not reference the key of the same
context entry but may reference keys (as QNs) from previous context
entries in the same context, as well as other values (as QNs) in scope.</p>
<p>These references SHALL be acyclic and form a partial order. The
expressions in a context SHALL be evaluated consistent with this partial
order.</p>
<h4>Ranges</h4>
<p>FEEL supports a compact syntax for a range of values, useful in decision
table test cells and elsewhere. Ranges can be syntactically represented
either:</p>
<p>a)  as a comparison operator and a single endpoint (grammar rule 7.a.)</p>
<p>b)  or a pair of endpoints and endpoint inclusivity flags that indicate
whether one or both endpoints are included in the range (grammar
rule 7.b.); on this case, endpoints must be of equivalent types (see
section 10.3.2.9.1for the definition of type equivalence) and the
endpoints must be ordered such that range start &lt;= range end.</p>
<p>Endpoints can be expressions (grammar rule 16) of the following types:
number, string, date, time, date and time, or duration. The following
are examples of valid ranges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&lt; 10</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&gt;= date(&quot;2019-03-31&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&gt;= @&quot;2019-03-31&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lt;= duration(&quot;PT01H&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lt;= @&quot;PT01H&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[ 5 .. 10 ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>( birthday .. @&quot;2019-01-01&quot; )</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ranges are mapped into the semantic domain as a typed instance of the
<em>range</em> type. If the syntax with a single endpoint and an operator is
used, then the other endpoint is undefined and the inclusivity flag is
set to false. E.g.:</p>
<p>+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| &gt; <strong>range</strong> | &gt; <strong>start   | &gt; start | &gt; end   | end       |
|             | &gt;           |             |             | included  |
|             |  included</strong> |             |             |             |
+=============+=============+=============+=============+=============+
| &gt; [1..10] | &gt; true      | &gt; 1         | &gt; 10        | true        |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| &gt; (1..10]  | &gt; false     | &gt; 1         | &gt; 10        | true        |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| &gt; &lt;= 10    | &gt; false     | &gt; undefined | &gt; 10        | true        |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| &gt; &gt; 1      | &gt; false     | &gt; 1         | &gt; undefined | false       |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+</p>
<p>: <strong>Table 62: Semantics of negative numbers and negation of durations</strong></p>
<p>The semantics of comparison expressions involving ranges (grammar rules
49c and 49d) is defined in Table 55, Table 54, Table 52, and Table 50.
The same rules apply when ranges are created programmatically, e.g.,
using the range function.</p>
<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>The FEEL function literal is given by grammar rule 55. Functions can
also be specified in <strong>DMN</strong> via Function Definitions (see 6.3.9). The
constructed type (<em>T</em>1, . . . , <em>Tn</em>) → <em>U</em> contains the function values
that take arguments of types <em>T1, . . . , Tn</em> and yield results of type
<em>U,</em> regardless of the way the function syntax (e.g., FEEL literal or
<strong>DMN</strong> Function Definition). In the case of exactly one argument type
<em>T</em> → <em>U</em> is a shorthand for (<em>T</em> ) → <em>U</em>.</p>
<h4>Relations between types</h4>
<p>Every FEEL expression executed in a certain context has a value in
<strong>D</strong>, and every value has a type. The FEEL types are organized as a
lattice (see Figure 10-26), with upper type <em>Any</em> and lower type <em>Null</em>.
The lattice determines the conformance of the different types to each
other. For example, because comparison is defined only between values
with conforming types, you cannot compare a number with a boolean or a
string.</p>
<p>We define <strong>type(<em><strong>e</strong></em>)</strong> as the type of the domain element
**FEEL(**<em>e,</em> <strong>c),</strong> where <em>e</em> is an expression defined by grammar
rule 1. Literals for numbers, strings, booleans, null, date, time, date
and time and duration literals are mapped to the corresponding node in
lattice <strong>L</strong>. Complex expression such as list, contexts and functions
are mapped to the corresponding parameterized nodes in lattice <strong>L</strong>. .
For example, see <strong>Table <em>43</em></strong>.</p>

<p>: <strong>Table 63: Semantics of invocation</strong></p>
<p>A type expression <em>e</em> defined by grammar rule 54 is mapped to the nodes
in the lattice <strong>L</strong> by function <strong>type(<em><strong>e</strong></em>)</strong> as follows: primitive
data type names are mapped to the node with the same name (e.g.,
<em>string</em> is mapped the <strong>string</strong> node)</p>
<p>• <em>Any</em> is mapped to the node <strong>Any</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Null</em> is mapped to the node <strong>Null</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>list&lt; T&gt;</em> is mapped to the <strong>list</strong> node with the parameter
<strong>type(<em><strong>T</strong></em>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>context(k1:T1, ..., k~n~:T~n~&gt; where n≥1</em> is mapped to the
<strong>context</strong> node with parameters k1: <strong>type(<em><strong>T1</strong></em>)</strong>, ..., k~n~:
<strong>type(<em><strong>T~n~</strong></em>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>function&lt; T1, ... T~n~&gt; -&gt; T</em> is mapped to the <strong>function</strong>
node with signature <strong>type(<em><strong>T1</strong></em>)</strong>, ..., <strong>type(<em><strong>T~n~</strong></em>)</strong>
-&gt; <strong>type(<em><strong>T</strong></em>)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type names defined in the <em>itemDefinitions</em> section are mapped
similarly to the context types (see rule above).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If none of the above rules can be applied (e.g., type name does not
exist in the decision model) the type expression is semantically
incorrect.<br />
We define two relations between types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equivalence (T ≡ S): Types T and S are interchangeable in all
contexts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conformance (T &lt;:S): An instance of type T can be substituted at each
place where an instance of type S is expected.</p>
<h5>Type Equivalence</h5>
<p>The equivalence relationship (≡) between types is defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Primitive datatypes are equivalent to themselves, e.g., string ≡
string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two list types <em>list&lt; T&gt;</em> and <em>list&lt;S&gt;</em> are equivalent iff <em>T</em>
is equivalent to <em>S</em>. For example, the types of [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] and
[&quot;c&quot;] are equivalent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two context types <em>context&lt;k~1~: T~1~, ..., k~n~: T~n~&gt;</em> and
<em>context&lt;l~1~: S ~1~, ..., l~m~: S~m~&gt;</em> are equivalent iff n = m
and for every <em>k~i~ :T~i~</em> there is a unique <em>l~j~ :S~j~</em> such that
<em>k~i~ = l~j~</em> and <em>T~i~</em> ≡ <em>S~j~</em> for i = 1, n. Context types are
the types defined via ItemDefinitions or the types associated to
FEEL context literals such as { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 25}.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two function types (<em>T~1~, ..., T~n~) →U</em> and (<em>S~1~, ..., S~m~)
→V</em> are equivalent iff n = m, <em>T~i~</em> ≡ <em>S~j~</em> for i = 1, n and <em>U</em> ≡
<em>V</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two range types <em>range&lt; T&gt;</em> and <em>range&lt;S&gt;</em> are equivalent iff
<em>T</em> is equivalent to <em>S</em>. For example, the types of [1..10] and
[30..40] are equivalent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Type equivalence is transitive: if <em>type1</em> is equivalent to <em>type2</em>, and
<em>type2 is equivalent to type3</em>, then <em>type1</em> is equivalent to <em>type3</em>.</p>
<h5>Type Conformance</h5>
<p>The conformance relation (&lt;:) is defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Conformance includes equivalence. If <em>T</em> ≡ <em>S</em> then <em>T</em> &lt;: <em>S</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For every type <em>T</em>, <em>Null</em> &lt;: <em>T</em> &lt;: <em>Any,</em> where <em>Null</em> is the
lower type in the lattice and <em>Any</em> the upper type in the lattice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The list type <em>list&lt; T&gt;</em> conforms to <em>list&lt;S&gt;</em> iff <em>T</em> conforms
to <em>S.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The context type <em>context&lt;k~1~: T~1~, ..., k~n~: T~n~&gt;</em> conforms
to <em>context&lt;l~1~: S ~1~, ..., l~m~: S~m~&gt;</em> iff n ≥ m and for
every <em>li : S~i~</em> there is a unique <em>~kj:Tj~</em> such that <em>l~i~ =
k~j~</em> and <em>T~j~</em> &lt;: <em>S~i~</em> for i = 1, m</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The function type (<em>T~1~, ..., T~n~) →U</em> conforms to type (<em>S~1~,
..., S~m~) →V</em> iff n = m, <em>S~i~</em> &lt;: <em>T~i~</em> for i = 1, n and <em>U</em>
&lt;: <em>V</em>. The FEEL functions follow the &quot;contravariant function
argument type&quot; and &quot;covariant function return type&quot; principles to
provide type safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The range type <em>range&lt; T&gt;</em> conforms to <em>range&lt; S&gt;</em> iff T
conforms to S. Type conformance is transitive: if <em>type1</em> conforms
to <em>type2</em>, and <em>type2</em> conforms to <em>type3</em>, then <em>type1</em> conforms
to <em>type3</em>.</p>

<p>Let us consider the following ItemDefinitions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;itemDefinition name=&quot;Employee1&quot;&gt; &lt;itemComponent name=&quot;id&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;typeRef&gt;number&lt;/typeRe f&gt; &lt;/itemComponent&gt; &lt;itemComponent
name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;typeRef&gt;string&lt;/typeRef&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/itemComponent&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/itemDefinition&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;itemDefinition name=&quot;Employee2&quot;&gt; &lt;itemComponent name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;typeRef&gt;string&lt;/typeRe f&gt; &lt;/itemComponent&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;itemComponent name=&quot;id&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;typeRef&gt;number&lt;/typeRef&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/itemCompone nt&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/itemDefinition&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;itemDefinition name=&quot;Employee3&quot;&gt; &lt;itemComponent name=&quot;id&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;typeRef&gt;number&lt;/typeRe f&gt; &lt;/itemComponent&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;itemComponent name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;typeRef&gt;string&lt;/typeRef&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/itemComponent&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;itemComponent name=&quot;age&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;typeRef&gt;number&lt;/typeRe f&gt; &lt;/itemComponent&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/itemDefinition&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;itemDefinition isCollection=&quot;true&quot; name=&quot;Employee3List&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;itemComponent name=&quot;id&quot;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;typeRef&gt;number&lt;/typeRe f&gt; &lt;/itemComponent&gt; &lt;itemComponent

<h5>Type conversions</h5>
<p>The type of a FEEL expression <em>e</em> is determined from the value <strong>e</strong> =
FEEL(<em>e</em>, <em><strong>s</strong></em>) in the semantic domain, where <em><strong>s</strong></em> is a set of
variable bindings (see 10.3.2.11and 10.3.2.12). When an expression
appears in a certain context it must be compatible with a type expected
in that context, called the <em>target type</em>. After the type of the
expression is deduced, an implicit conversion from the type of the
expression to the target type can be performed sometimes. If an implicit
conversion is mandatory but it cannot be performed the result is
<strong>null</strong>.</p>
<p>In implicit type conversions, the data type is converted automatically
without loss of information. There are several possible implicit type
conversions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>to singleton list</em>:\</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the type of the expression is T and the target type is
List&lt;T&gt; the expression is converted to a singleton list.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>from singleton list</em>:\</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the type of the expression is List&lt;T&gt;, the value of the
expression is a singleton list and the target type is T, the
expression is converted by unwrapping the first element.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>from date to date and time</em>:\</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the type of the expression is date and the target type is
date and time, the expression is converted to a date time value in
which the time of day is UTC midnight (00:00:00).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is one type of conversion to handle semantic errors:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>conforms to</em> (as defined in 10.3.2.9.2 Type Conformance):\
<blockquote>
<p>When the type of the expression is S, the target type is T, and S
conforms to T the value of expression remains unchanged. Otherwise
the result is <strong>null</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several kinds of contexts in which conversions may occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Filter context (10.3.2.5) in which a filter expression is present.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The expression to be filtered is subject to implicit conversion
<em>to singleton list</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invocation context (Table 63) in which an actual parameter is bound</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to a formal parameter of a function. The actual parameter is
subject to implicit conversions.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Binding contexts in which the result of a DRG Element's logic is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bound to the output variable. If after applying the implicit
conversions the converted value and the target type do not
conform, the <em>conforms to</em> conversion is applied.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h6>Examples</h6>
<p>The table below contains several examples for singleton list
conversions.</p>

<p>In the example below, before binding variable <em>decision_003</em> to value
<em>&quot;123&quot;</em> the conversion to the target type (number) fails, hence the
variable is bound to <em>null</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;<strong>decision name=&quot;decision_003&quot; id=&quot;_decision_003&quot;</strong>&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;/<strong>literalExpression</strong>&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lt;/<strong>decision</strong>&gt;</p>
<h4>Decision Table</h4>
<p>The normative notation for decision tables is specified in Clause 8.
Each input expression SHALL be a textual expression (grammar rule 2).
Each list of input values SHALL be an instance of unary tests (grammar
rule 15). The value that is tested is the value of the input expression
of the containing InputClause. Each list of output values SHALL be an
instance of unary tests (grammar rule 15). The value that is tested is
the value of a selected output entry of the containing OutputClause.
Each input entry SHALL be an instance of unary tests (grammar rule 15).
Rule annotations are ignored in the execution semantics.</p>
<p>The decision table components are shown in Figure 8-5: Rules as rows --
schematic layout, and also correspond to the metamodel in clause 8.3 For
convenience, Figure 8-5 is reproduced here.</p>

<p>: <strong>Table 68: Semantics of lists</strong></p>
<p>The semantics of a decision table is specified by first composing its
literal expressions and unary tests into Boolean expressions that are
mapped to the semantic domain and composed into rule matches then rule
hits. Finally, some of the decision table output expressions are mapped
to the semantic domain and comprise the result of the decision table
interpretation. Decision table components are detailed in Table 46.</p>

<p>: <strong>Table 70: Semantics of XML elements</strong></p>
<p>Unary tests (grammar rule 15) are used to represent both input values
and input entries. An input expression <em>e</em> is said to <em>satisfy</em> an input
entry <em>t</em> (with optional input values <em>v</em>), depending on the syntax of
<em>t</em>, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>grammar rule 15.a: FEEL(<em>e in (t)</em>)<strong>=true</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>grammar rule 15.b: FEEL(<em>e in (t)</em>)<strong>=false</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>grammar rule 15.c when <em>v</em> is not provided: <strong>e != null</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>grammar rule 15.c when <em>v</em> is provided: FEEL(<em>e in (v)</em>)<strong>=true</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A rule with input entries <em>t1,t2,...,tN</em> is said to <em>match</em> the input
expression list <em>[e1,e2,...,eN]</em> (with optional input values list
<em>[v1,v2, ...vN]</em>) if <em>ei satisfies ti</em> (with optional input values
<em>vi</em>) for all <em>i</em> in 1..N.</p>
<p>A rule is <em>hit</em> if it is matched, and the hit policy indicates that the
matched rule's output value should be included in the decision table
result. Each hit results in one output value (multiple outputs are
collected into a single context value). Therefore, multiple hits require
aggregation.</p>
<p>The hit policy is specified using the initial letter of one of the
following boldface policy names.</p>
<p>Single hit policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unique</strong> -- only a single rule can be matched.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Any</strong> -- multiple rules can match, but they all have the same</p>
<blockquote>
<p>output,</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Priority</strong> -- multiple rules can match, with different outputs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The output that comes first in the supplied <em>output values</em> list
is returned,</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>First</strong> -- return the first match in rule order,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple hit policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Collect</strong> -- return a list of the outputs in arbitrary order,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rule order</strong> -- return a list of outputs in rule order,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Output order</strong> -- return a list of outputs in the order of the</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>output values</em> list</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Collect policy may optionally specify an <em>aggregation</em>, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>C+</strong> -- return the sum of the outputs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>C#</strong> -- return the count of the outputs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>C&lt;</strong> -- return the minimum-valued output</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>C&gt;</strong> -- return the maximum-valued output</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>aggregation</em> is defined using the following built-in functions
specified in clause 10.3.4.4: <em>sum, count, minimum, maximum</em>. To reduce
complexity, decision tables with compound outputs do not support
aggregation and support only the following hit policies: <em>Unique</em>,
<em>Any</em>, <em>Priority, First</em>, <em>Collect without operator</em>, and <em>Rule order</em>.</p>
<p>A decision table may have no rule hit for a set of input values. In this
case, the result is given by the default output value, or <strong>null</strong> if no
default output value is specified. A complete decision table SHALL NOT
specify a default output value.</p>
<p>The semantics of a decision table invocation <strong>DTI</strong> are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Every rule in the rule list is matched with the input expression
list. Matching is unordered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no rules match,</p>
<p>a.  if a default output value <em>d</em> is specified, **DTI=**FEEL(<em>d</em>)</p>
<p>b.  else <strong>DTI=null</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Else let <em>m</em> be the sublist of rules that match the input expression
list. If the hit policy is &quot;First&quot; or &quot;Rule order&quot;, order <em>m</em> by
rule number.</p>
<p>a.  Let <em>o</em> be a list of output expressions, where the expression at
index <em>i</em> is the output expression from rule <em>m[i]</em>. The
output expression of a rule in a single output decision table is
simply the rule's output entry. The output expression of a
multiple output decision table is a context with entries
composed from the output names and the rule's corresponding
output entries. If the hit policy is &quot;Output order&quot;, the
decision table SHALL be single output and <em>o</em> is ordered
consistent with the order of the <em>output values</em>. Rule
annotations are ignored for purposes of determining the
expression value of a decision table.</p>
<p>b.  If a multiple hit policy is specified, DTI=FEEL(aggregation(o)),
where aggregation is one of the built-in functions <em>sum, count,
minimum</em> as specified in clause 10.3.4.4.</p>
<p>c.  else **DTI=**FEEL(<em>o[1]</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Scope and context stack</h4>
<p>A FEEL expression <em>e</em> is always evaluated in a well-defined set of name
bindings that are used to resolve QNs in <em>e</em>. This set of name bindings
is called the scope of <em>e</em>. Scope is modeled as a list of contexts. A
scope <strong>s</strong> contains the contexts with entries that are in scope for
<em>e</em>. The last context in <strong>s</strong> is the <em>built-in</em> context. Next to last
in <strong>s</strong> is the <em>global</em> context. The first context in <strong>s</strong> is the
context immediately containing <em>e</em> (if any). Next are enclosing contexts
of <em>e</em> (if any).</p>
<p>The QN of <em>e</em> is the QN of the first context in <strong>s</strong> appended with .N,
where N is the name of entry in the first context of <strong>s</strong> containing
<em>e.</em> QNs in <em>e</em> are resolved by looking through the contexts in <strong>s</strong>
from first to last.</p>
<h5>Local context</h5>
<p>If <em>e</em> denotes the value of a context entry of context <strong>m</strong>, then <strong>m</strong>
is the local context for <em>e</em>, and <strong>m</strong> is the first element of <strong>s.</strong>
Otherwise, <em>e</em> has no local context and the first element of <strong>s</strong> is
the global context, or in some cases explained later, the first element
of <strong>s</strong> is a special context.</p>
<p>All of the entries of <strong>m</strong> are in-scope for <em>e</em>, but the <em>depends on</em>
graph SHALL be acyclic. This provides a simple solution to the problem
of the confusing definition above: if <strong>m</strong> is the result of evaluating
the context expression <em>m</em> that contains <em>e</em>, how can we know it in
order to evaluate <em>e</em>? Simply evaluate the context entries in <em>depends
on</em> order.</p>
<h5>Global context</h5>
<p>The global context is a context created before the evaluation of <em>e</em> and
contains names and values for the variables defined outside expression
<em>e</em> that are accessible in <em>e</em>. For example, when <em>e</em> is the body of a
decision <em>D</em>, the global context contains entries for the information
requirements and knowledge requirements of <em>D</em> (<em>i.e.,</em> names and logic
of the business knowledge models, decisions and decision services
required by <em>D)</em>.</p>
<h5>Built-in context</h5>
<p>The built-in context contains all the built-in functions.</p>
<h5>Special context</h5>
<p>Some FEEL expressions are interpreted in a <em>special</em> context that is
pushed on the front of <strong>s</strong>. For example, a filter expression is
repeatedly executed with special first context containing the name
'item' bound to successive list elements. A function is executed with
a special first context containing argument name-&gt;value mappings.</p>
<p>Qualified names (QNs) in FEEL expressions are interpreted relative to
<strong>s</strong>. The meaning of a FEEL expression <em>e</em> in scope <strong>s</strong> is denoted as
**FEEL(**<em>e,</em> <strong>s)</strong>. We can also say that <em>e</em> evaluates to <strong>e</strong> in
scope <strong>s</strong>, or <strong>e</strong> = **FEEL(**<em>e,</em> <strong>s)</strong>. Note that <strong>e</strong> and <strong>s</strong>
are elements of the FEEL domain. <strong>s</strong> is a list of contexts.</p>
<h4>Mapping between FEEL and other domains</h4>
<p>A FEEL expression <em>e</em> denotes a value <strong>e</strong> in the semantic domain. Some
kinds of values can be passed between FEEL and external Java methods,
between FEEL and external PMML models, and between FEEL and XML, as
summarized in Table 47. An empty cell means that no mapping is defined.</p>

<p>: <strong>Table 71: Semantics of XML values</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we do not want to evaluate a FEEL expression <em>e</em>, we just want
to know the type of <strong>e</strong>*.* Note that if <em>e</em> has QNs, then a context
may be needed for type inference. We write <strong>type(<em><strong>e</strong></em>)</strong> as the type
of the domain element **FEEL(**<em>e,</em> <strong>c)</strong>.</p>
<h4>Functions Seamantics</h4>
<p>FEEL functions can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>built-in, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>sum</em> (see clause 10.3.4.4), or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>user-defined, <em>e.g., function(age) age &lt; 21</em>, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>externally defined, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>function(angle) external {</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>java: {</em></p>
<p><em>class: &quot;java.lang.Math &quot;, method signature: &quot;cos(double)&quot; }}</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Built-in Functions</h5>
<p>The built-in functions are described in detail in section 10.3.4. In
particular, function signatures and parameter domains are specified.
Some functions have more than one signature.</p>
<p>Built-in functions are invoked using the same syntax as other functions
(grammar rule 40). The actual parameters must conform to the parameter
domains in at least one signature before or after applying implicit
conversions, or the result of the invocation is <strong>null</strong>.</p>
<h5>User-defined functions</h5>
<p>User-defined functions (grammar rule 55) have the form <em>function(X1,
... Xn) body</em></p>
<p>The terms <em>X1, ... Xn</em> are formal parameters. Each formal parameter has
the form <em>ni</em> or <em>ni</em> :<em>ti</em>, where the <em>ni</em> are the parameter names and
<em>ti</em> are their types. If the type isn't specified, <em>Any</em> is assumed. The
meaning of</p>
<p>FEEL(<em>function(X1, ... X~n~) body</em>, <strong>s</strong>) is an element in the FEEL
semantic domain that we denote as <strong>function(argument list: [<em><strong>X1,
... X~n~</strong></em>], body:</strong> <em>body</em>**, scope: s)** (shortened to <strong>f</strong>
below). FEEL functions are lexical closures, <em>i.e.,</em> the <em>body</em> is an
expression that references the formal parameters and any other names in
scope <strong>s</strong>.</p>
<p>User-defined functions are invoked using the same syntax as other
functions (grammar rule 38). The meaning of an invocation
<em>f(n1:e1,</em>...<em>,nn:en)</em> in scope <strong>s</strong> is FEEL(<em>f,</em> <strong>s</strong>) applied to
arguments *n1:*FEEL(<em>e1,</em> <strong>s</strong>)... *,nn:*FEEL(<em>en,</em> <strong>s</strong>). This can
also be written as <strong>f(n</strong>1:<strong>e</strong>1... *,*<strong>n</strong>~n~:<strong>e</strong>~n~).</p>
<p>The arguments <strong>n</strong>1:<strong>e</strong>1... <em>,<em><strong>n</strong>~n~:<strong>e</strong>~n~ conform to the
argument list <strong>[<em><strong>X1, ... X~n~</strong></em>]</strong> if <strong>type(e</strong>i</em></em>)** conforms
to <em>ti</em> before or after applying implicit conversions or <em>ti</em> is not
specified in <em>Xi</em>, for all <em>i</em> in <em>1. .n.</em> The result of applying <strong>f</strong>
to the interpreted arguments <strong>n</strong>1:<strong>e</strong>1... *,*<strong>n</strong>~n~:<strong>e</strong>~n~ is
determined as follows. If <strong>f</strong> is not a function, or if the arguments
do not conform to the argument list, the result of the invocation is
<strong>null</strong>. Otherwise, let <strong>c</strong> be a context with entries
<strong>n</strong>1:<strong>e</strong>1... *,*<strong>n</strong>~n~:<strong>e</strong>~n~. The result of the invocation is
FEEL(<em>body, <strong>s'</strong></em>), where <strong>s'</strong> = insert before(<strong>s</strong>, 1, <strong>c</strong>)
(see 10.3.4.4).</p>
<p>Invocable elements (Business Knowledge Models or Decision Services) are
invoked using the same syntax as other functions (grammar rule 38). An
Invocable is equivalent to a FEEL function whose parameters are the
invocable's inputs (see 10.4)</p>
<h5>Externally-defined functions</h5>
<p>FEEL externally-defined functions have the following form <em>function (X1,
... X~n~) external mapping-information</em></p>
<p>Mapping-information is a context that SHALL have one of the following
forms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>{</em></p>
<p><em>java: {class: class-name, method signature: method-signature}</em></p>
<p><em>}</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>{</em></p>
<p><em>pmml: {document: IRI, model: model-name}</em></p>
<p><em>}</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The meaning of an externally defined function is an element in the
semantic domain that we denote as <strong>function(argument list: [<em><strong>X1,
... X~n~</strong></em>], external: mapping-information)</strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>java</em> form of the mapping information indicates that the external
function is to be accessed as a method on a Java class. The <em>class-name</em>
SHALL be the string name of a Java class on the classpath. Classpath
configuration is implementation-defined. The <em>method-signature</em> SHALL be
a string consisting of the name of a public static method in the named
class, followed by an argument list containing only Java argument type
names. The argument type information SHOULD be used to resolve
overloaded methods and MAY be used to detect out-of-domain errors before
runtime.</p>
<p>The <em>pmml</em> form of the mapping information indicates that the external
function is to be accessed as a PMML model. The <em>IRI</em> SHALL be the
resource identifier for a PMML document. The <em>model-name</em> is optional.
If the <em>model-name</em> is specified, it SHALL be the name of a model in the
document to which the <em>IRI</em> refers. If no <em>model-name</em> is specified, the
external function SHALL be the first model in the document.</p>
<p>When an externally-defined function is invoked, actual argument values
and result value are converted when possible, using the type mapping
table for Java or PMML (see Table 47). When a conversion is not
possible, <strong>null</strong> is substituted. If a result cannot be obtained,
<em>e.g.,</em> an exception is thrown, the result of the invocation is
<strong>null</strong>. If the externally-defined function is of type PMML, and PMML
invocation results in a single predictor output, the result of the
externally-defined function is the single predictor output's value.</p>
<p>Passing parameter values to the external method or model requires
knowing the expected parameter types. For Java, this information is
obtained using reflection. For PMML, this information is obtained from
the mining schema and data dictionary elements associated with
independent variables of the selected model.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>DMN</strong> does not completely define the semantics of a Decision
Model that uses externally-defined functions. Externally-defined
functions SHOULD have no side-effects and be deterministic.</p>
<h5>Function name</h5>
<p>To name a function, define it as a context entry. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>{ isPositive : function(x) x &gt; 0,</em></p>
<p><em>isNotNegative : function(x) isPositive(x+</em></p>
<p><em>1), result: isNotNegative(0)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>}</em></p>
<h5>Positional and named parameters</h5>
<p>An invocation of any FEEL function (built-in, user-defined, or
externally-defined) can use positional parameters or named parameters.
If positional, all parameters SHALL be supplied. If named, unsupplied
parameters are bound to <strong>null</strong>.</p>
<h4>For loop expression</h4>
<p>The <em>for loop expression</em> iterates over lists of elements or ranges of
numbers or dates. The general syntax is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>for i~1~ in ic~1~ [, i~2~ in ic~2~ [, ...]] return e</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>ic~1~, ic~2~, ..., ic~n~</em> are <em>iteration contexts</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>i~1~, i~2~, ..., i~n~</em> are variables bound to each element in the
<em>iteration context</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>e</em> is the <strong>return</strong> expression</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An <em>iteration context</em> may either be an expression that returns a list
of elements, or two expressions that return integers connected by &quot;..&quot;.
Examples of valid iteration contexts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[ 1, 2, 3]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a list</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1..10</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>50..40</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>x..x+10</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>@&quot;2021-01-01&quot;..@&quot;2022-01-01&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>for loop expression</em> will iterate over each element in the <em>iteration
context</em>, binding the element to the corresponding variable <em>i~n~</em> and
evaluating the expression <em>e</em> in that scope.</p>
<p>When the <em>iteration context</em> is a range of numbers, the <em>for loop
expression</em> will iterate over the range incrementing or decrementing the
value of <em>i~n~</em> by 1, depending if the range is ascendant (when the
resulting integer from the first expression is lower than the second) or
descendant (when the resulting integer from the first expression is
higher than the second).</p>
<p>When the <em>iteration context</em> is a range of dates, the <em>for loop
expression</em> will iterate over the range incrementing or decrementing the
value of i ~n~ by 1 day, depending if the range is ascendant (when the
resulting date from the first expression is lower than the second) or
descendant (when the resulting date from the first expression is higher
than the second).</p>
<p>The result of the <em>for loop expression</em> is a list containing the result
of the evaluation of the expression <em>e</em> for each individual iteration in
order.</p>
<p>The expression <em>e</em> may also reference an implicitly defined variable
called &quot;<em><strong>partial</strong></em>&quot; that is a list containing all the results of the
previous iterations of the expression. The variable &quot;<em><strong>partial</strong></em>&quot; is
immutable. E.g.: to calculate the factorial list of numbers, from 0 to
N, where N is a non-negative integer, one may write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>for i in 0..N return if i = 0 then 1 else i * partial[-1]</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When multiple <em>iteration contexts</em> are defined in the same <em>for loop
expression</em>, the resulting iteration is a crossproduct of the elements
of the <em>iteration contexts</em>. The iteration order is from the inner
<em>iteration context</em> to the outer <em>iteration context</em>.</p>
<p>E.g., the result of the following <em>for loop expression</em> is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>for i in [i~1~,i~2~], j in [j~1~j~2~] return e <strong>= [ r~1~, r~2~,
r~3~, r~4~ ]</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>r~1~ = FEEL( e, { i: i~1~, j: j~1~, partial:[], ... } ) r~2~ =
FEEL( e, { i: i~1~, j: j~2~, partial:[r~1~], ... ) r~3~ = FEEL( e,
{ i: i~2~, j: j~1~, partial:[r~1~,r~2~], ... } )</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>r~4~ = FEEL( e, { i: i~2~, j: j~2~, partial:[r~1~,r~2~,r~3~], ...
} )</strong></em></p>
<h4>Semantic mappings</h4>
<p>The meaning of each substantive grammar rule is given below by mapping
the syntax to a value in the semantic domain. The value may depend on
certain input values, themselves having been mapped to the semantic
domain. The input values may have to obey additional constraints. The
input domain(s) may be a subset of the semantic domain. Inputs outside
of their domain result in a <strong>null</strong> value unless the implicit
conversion <em>from singleton list</em> (10.3.2.9.4) can be applied.</p>

arguments or named arguments. If positional, all arguments must be
supplied. If named, unsupplied arguments are bound to <strong>null</strong>. Note
that <strong>e</strong> can be a user-defined function, a user-defined external
function, or a built-in function. The arguments are subject to implicit

<h4>Error Handling</h4>
<p>When a built-in function encounters input that is outside its defined
domain, the function SHOULD report or log diagnostic information if
appropriate and SHALL return <strong>null</strong>.</p>
<h3>XML Data</h3>
<p>FEEL supports XML Data in the FEEL context by mapping XML Data into the
FEEL Semantic Domain. Let XE(<em>e</em>, <strong>p</strong>) be a function mapping an XML
element <em>e</em> and a parent FEEL context <strong>p</strong> to a FEEL context , as
defined in the following tables. XE makes use of another mapping
function, XV(<em>v</em>), that maps an XML value <em>v</em> to the FEEL semantic
domain.</p>
<p>XML namespace semantics are not supported by the mappings. For example,
given the namespace prefix declarations <em>xmlns:p1=
&quot;<a href="http://example.org/foobar">[http://example.org/foobar]{.underline}&quot;</a></em>
and <em>xmlns:p2= &quot;<a href="http://example.org/foobar">[http://example.
org/foobar]{.underline}&quot;</a></em>, the tags
<em>p1:myElement</em> and <em>p2:myElement</em> are the same element using XML
namespace semantics but are different using XML without namespace
semantics.</p>
<h4>Semantic mapping for XML elements (XE)</h4>
<p>Table 70, <em>e</em> is the name of an XML element, <em>a</em> is the name of one of
its attributes, <em>c</em> is a child element, and <em>v</em> is a value. The parent
context <strong>p</strong> is initially empty.</p>

<p>: <strong>Table 108: Depiction Resolution of Knowledge Requirement</strong></p>
<p>An entry in the <strong>context entry in p</strong> column such as <strong>&quot;e&quot; : null</strong>
indicates a context entry with string key <strong>&quot;e&quot;</strong> and value <strong>null</strong>.
The context entries are contained by context <strong>p</strong> that corresponds to
the containing XML element, or to the XML document itself.</p>
<p>The mapping does not replace namespace prefixes with the namespace IRIs.
FEEL requires only that keys within a context be distinct, and the
namespace prefixes are sufficient.</p>
<h4>Semantic mapping for XML values (XV)</h4>
<p>If an XML document was parsed with a schema, then some atomic values may
have a datatype other than string. Table 71defines how a typed XML value
<em>v</em> is mapped to FEEL.</p>

<p>When a decision model is evaluated, its input data described by an item
definition such as an XML Schema element</p>
<p>(clause 7.3.2) is bound to case data mapped to the FEEL domain. The case
data can be in various formats, such as XML. We can notate case data as
an equivalent boxed context, as above. Decision logic can reference
entries in the context using expressions such as
<em>Context.tns$Employee.tns$salary</em>, which has a value of 13000.</p>
<h3>Built-in functions</h3>
<p>To promote interoperability, FEEL includes a library of built-in
functions. The syntax and semantics of the built-ins are required for a
conformant FEEL implementation.</p>
<p>In all of the tables in this section, a superscript refers to an
additional domain constraint stated in the corresponding footnote to the
table. Whenever a parameter is outside its domain, the result of the
built-in is <strong>null</strong>.</p>
<h4>Conversion functions</h4>
<p>FEEL supports many conversions between values of different types. Of
particular importance is the conversion from strings to dates, times,
and durations. There is no literal representation for date, time, or
duration. Also, formatted numbers such as <em>1,000.00</em> must be converted
from a string by specifying the grouping separator and the decimal
separator.</p>
<p>Built-ins are summarized in Table 72. The first column shows the name
and parameters. A question mark (<em>?</em>) denotes an optional parameter. The
second column specifies the domain for the parameters. The parameter
domain is specified as one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a type, <em>e.g.,</em> number, string</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any -- any element from the semantic domain, including <strong>null</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not null -- any element from the semantic domain, excluding <strong>null</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>date string -- a string value in the lexical space of the date</p>
<blockquote>
<p>datatype specified by XML Schema Part 2 Datatypes</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>time string -- either</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>a string value in the lexical space of the time datatype specified by
XML Schema Part 2 Datatypes; or a string value that is the extended
form of a local time representation as specified by ISO 8601, followed
by the character &quot;@&quot;, followed by a string value that is a time zone
identifier in the IANA Time Zones Database
<a href="http://www.iana.org/time-zones">([http://www.iana.org/time-zones)]{.underline}</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>date time string -- a string value consisting of a date string</p>
<blockquote>
<p>value, as specified above, optionally followed by the character
&quot;T&quot; followed by a time string value as specified above.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>duration string -- a string value in the lexical space of the</p>
<blockquote>
<p>xs:dayTimeDuration or xs:yearMonthDuration datatypes specified by
the XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Data Model.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>range string -- a string value conforming to grammar rule 66 &quot;range</p>
<blockquote>
<p>literal&quot; as defined in chapter 10.3.1.2.</p>

<h4>Range Functions</h4>
<p>The following set of functions establish relationships between single
scalar values and ranges of such values. All functions in this list take
two arguments and return True if the relationship between the argument
holds, or False otherwise.</p>
<p>The specification of these functions is heavily inspired by the
equivalent functions in the HL7 CQL (Clinical Quality Language) standard
version 1.4.</p>
<p><em>The following table intuitively depicts the relationships defined by
the functions in this chapter, but the full semantics of the functions
are listed in</em> Table 78.</p>

<h4>Miscellaneous functions</h4>
<p>The following set of functions provide support utilities for several
miscellaneous use-cases. For example, when a decision depends on the
current date, like deciding the support SLA over the weekends,
additional charges for weekend delivery, etc.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the functions in this section are intended
to be side-effect-free, but they are not deterministic and not
idempotent from the perspective of an external observer.</p>
<p>Vendors are encouraged to guide end-users in ensuring deterministic
behavior of the DMN model during testing, for example, through specific
configuration.</p>
<p>Users are encouraged to isolate decision logic that uses these functions
in specific DRG elements, such as Decisions. This encapsulation enables
them to be overridden with synthetic values that remain constant across
executions of the DMN model's test cases.</p>

<h2>Execution Semantics of Decision Services</h2>
<p>FEEL gives execution semantics to decision services defined in decision
models where FEEL is the expression language. A decision service is
semantically equivalent to a FEEL function whose parameters are the
decision service inputs, and whose logic is a context assembled from the
decision service's decisions and knowledge requirements.</p>
<p>Decision service implementations SHALL return a result as described
above, and MAY return additional information such as intermediate
results, log records, debugging information, error messages, rule
annotations, etc. The format of any additional information is left
unspecified.</p>
<p>Every FEEL expression in a decision model has execution semantics.
LiteralExpression (FEEL text) semantics is defined in 10.3. Boxed
expressions described in 10.2.2 can be mapped to FEEL text and thus also
have execution semantics.</p>
<p>Recall that a DecisionService is defined by four lists: inputData,
inputDecisions, outputDecisions, and encapsulatedDecisions. The lists
are not independent and thus not all required to be specified, e.g.,
each required decision (direct and indirect) of the outputDecisions must
be an encapsulatedDecision, an inputDecision, or required by an
inputDecision. For simplicity in the following, we assume that all four
lists are correctly and completely specified.</p>
<p>A DecisionService is given execution semantics by mapping it to a FEEL
function <em>F</em>. Let S be a</p>
<p>DecisionService with input data <em>id1</em>, <em>id2</em>, ..., input decisions
<em>di1</em>, <em>di2</em>, ..., encapsulated decisions <em>de1</em>, <em>de2</em>, ..., and
output decisions <em>do1</em>, <em>do2</em>, .... Each input data <em>idi</em> has a
qualified name <em>nid~i~</em>. Each decision <em>di</em> has a qualified name
*nd~i\ ~*and a decision logic expression <em>ed</em>. The decisions may have
knowledge requirements. In particular the decisions may require
BusinessKnowledgeModels <em>bkm1</em>, <em>bkm2</em>, ... and DecisionServices <em>s1</em>,
<em>s2</em>, .... BusinessKnowledgeModels have qualified names *nbkm~i\ ~*and
encapsulatedLogic <em>f~bkmi~</em>. DecisionServices have qualified names <em>nsi</em>
and equivalent logic <em>fs~i~</em>, where the equivalent logic is defined
recursively, binding <em>si</em> to S.</p>
<p>The syntax for FEEL function <em>F</em> is <em>funcion(nid~1~, nid~2~, ...,
ndi~1~, ndi~2~, ... ) C.result</em>, where <em>C</em> is the context <em>{</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>ns~1~ : fs~1~, ns~2~ : fs~2~, ...,</em></p>
<p><em>nbkm1 : fbkm1, nbkm2 : fbkm2, ...,</em></p>
<p><em>nde~1~ : ede~1~, nde~2~ : ede~2~, ...,</em></p>
<p><em>result: { ndo~1~ : edo~1~, ndo~2~ : edo~2~, . ..}</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>such that <em>si</em>, <em>bkmi</em>, <em>dei</em> and <em>doi</em> are partially ordered by
requirements (e.g., the context entry for a required decision comes
before a decision that requires it).</p>
<p>The qualified name of an element named E (decision, input data, decision
service, or BKM) that is defined in the same decision model as S is
simply E. Otherwise, the qualified name is I.E, where I is the name of
the import element that refers to the model where E is defined.</p>
<p>The execution semantics of S is FEEL(<em>F</em>): a function that when invoked
with values from the FEEL semantic domain bound to the parameters
representing input data and input decisions, returns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the case of a single output decision(s), the single decision's</p>
<blockquote>
<p>output value.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of multiple output decisions, a context consisting of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>all the output decisions' output values.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>XML elements SHALL map to the FEEL semantic domain as specified in
section 10.3.3. Otherwise, details of the syntax of input/output data
values and mapping to/from FEEL are undefined.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 10-27: Expression class diagram</strong></p>
<p>The class Expression is extended to support the four new kinds of boxed
expressions introduced by FEEL, namely: Context, FunctionDefinition,
Relation and List.</p>
<p>Boxed expressions are Expressions that have a standard diagrammatic
representation (see clauses 7.2.1 and 10.2.1). FEEL <em>contexts</em>,
<em>function definitions</em>, <em>relations</em> and <em>lists</em> SHOULD be modeled as
Context, FunctionDefinition, Relation and List elements, respectively,
and represented as a boxed expression whenever possible; that is, when
they are top-level expressions, since an instance of LiteralExpression
cannot contain another Expression element.</p>
<h3>Context metamodel</h3>
<p>A Context is composed of any number of contextEntrys, which are
instances of ContextEntry.</p>
<p>A Context element is represented diagrammatically as a <strong>boxed context</strong>
(clause 10.2.1.4). A FEEL <em>context</em> (grammar rule 57 and clause
10.3.2.6) SHOULD be modeled as a Context element whenever possible.</p>
<p>Context inherits all the attributes and model associations from
Expression. Table 83 presents the additional attributes and model
associations of the Context element.</p>

| &gt; ContextEntry [*]       | ContextEntry that compose this         |
|                             | Context.                               |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------+</p>
<h3>ContextEntry metamodel</h3>
<p>The class ContextEntry is used to model FEEL <em>context entries</em> when a
<em>context</em> is modeled as a Context element. ContextEntry is a
specialization of DMNElement, from which it inherits the optional id,
description, and label attributes.</p>
<p>An instance of ContextEntry is composed of an optional variable, which
is an InformationItem element whose name is the <em>key</em> in the <em>context
entry</em>, and of a value, which is the instance of Expression that models
the <em>expression</em> in the <em>context entry</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Table <em>84</em></strong> presents the attributes and model associations of the
ContextEntry element.</p>
<p>+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------+

| &gt; <strong>value</strong>: Expression     | The instance of Expression that is the |
|                             | <em>expression</em> in this                   |
|                             |                                        |
|                             | ContextEntry                           |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------+</p>
<h3>FunctionDefinition metamodel</h3>
<p>A FunctionDefinition has formalParameters and a body. A
FunctionDefinition element is</p>
<p>represented diagrammatically as a <strong>boxed function</strong>, as described in
clause. A FEEL <em>function definition</em> (grammar rule 55 and clause
10.3.2.15) SHOULD be modeled as a FunctionDefinition element whenever
possible.</p>
<p>FunctionDefinition inherits all the attributes and model associations
from Expression. Table 85 presents the additional attributes and model
associations of the Function Definition element.</p>

+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------+</p>
<h3>List metamodel</h3>
<p>A List is simply a list of element, which are instances of Expressions.
A List element is represented diagrammatically as a <strong>boxed list</strong>, as
described in clause 10.2.1.5. A FEEL <em>list</em> (grammar rule 54 and clause
10.3.2.15) SHOULD be modeled as a List element whenever possible.</p>
<p>List inherits all the attributes and model associations from Expression.
Table 86 presents the additional attributes and model associations of
the List element.</p>
<p>+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------+</p>
<h3>Relation metamodel</h3>
<p>A Relation is convenient shorthand for a list of similar contexts. A
Relation has a column instead of repeated ContextEntrys, and a List is
used for every row, with one of the List's expression for each column
value.</p>

Expression. Table 87 presents the additional attributes and model
associations of the Relation element.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>A good way to get a quick overview of FEEL is by example.</p>
<p>FEEL expressions may reference other FEEL expressions by name. Named
expressions are contained in a context. Expressions are evaluated in a
scope, which is a list of contexts in which to resolve names. The result
of the evaluation is an element in the FEEL semantic domain.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Figure 10-28 shows the boxed context used for the examples. Such a
context could arise in several ways. It could be part of the decision
logic for a single, complex decision. Or it could be a context that is
equivalent to part of a DRG as defined in clause 10.4, where <em>applicant,
requested product,</em> and <em>credit history</em> are input data instances,
<em>monthly income</em> and <em>monthly outgoings</em> are the results of other
decisions linked through information requirements, and <em>PMT</em> is a
business knowledge model.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 10-28: Example context</strong></p>
<p>Notice that there are 6 top-level context entries, represented by the
six rows of the table. The value of the context entry named
'applicant' is itself a context, and the value of the context entry
named 'monthly' is itself a context. The value of the context entry
named 'monthly outgoings' is a list, the value of the context entry
named 'credit history' is a relation, <em>i.e.,</em> a list of two contexts,
one context per row. The value of the context entry named 'PMT' is a
function with parameters 'rate', 'term', and 'amount'.</p>
<p>The following examples use the above context. Each example has a pair of
equivalent FEEL expressions separated by a horizontal line. Both
expressions denote the same element in the semantic domain. The second
expression, the 'answer', is a literal value.</p>
<h3>Calculation</h3>
<p>monthly income * 12 120000</p>
<p>The context defines <em>monthly income</em> as <em>applicant.monthly.income</em>,
which is also defined in the context as 10,000. Twelve times the
<em>monthly income</em> is 120,000.</p>
<h3>If, In</h3>
<p>if applicant.maritalStatus in (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;S&quot;) then &quot;valid&quot; else &quot;not valid&quot;
&quot;valid&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>in</em> test determines if the left-hand side expression satisfies the
list of values or ranges on the right-hand side. If satisfied, the <em>if</em>
expression returns the value of the <em>then</em> expression. Otherwise, the
value of the <em>else</em> expression is returned.</p>
<h3>Sum entries of a list</h3>
<p>sum (monthly outgoings) 5500</p>
<p><em>Monthly outgoings</em> is computed in the context as the list
[<em>applicant.monthly.repayments, applicant.monthly.expenses</em>], or
[2500, 3000]. The square brackets are not required to be written in
the boxed context.</p>
<h3>Invocation of user-defined PMT function</h3>
<p>The PMT function defined in the context computes the monthly payments
for a given interest rate, number of months, and loan amount.</p>
<p>PMT (requested product . rate,<br />
requested product . term,<br />
[requested product .
amount)]{.underline}______________________________<br />
3975.982590125552338278440100112431</p>
<p>A function is invoked textually using a parenthesized argument list
after the function name. The arguments are defined in the context, and
are 0.25, 36, and 100,000, respectively.</p>
<h3>Sum weights of a recent credit history</h3>
<p>sum (credit history[record date &gt; date (&quot;2011-01-01&quot;)].weight<br />
150</p>
<p>This is a complex &quot;one-liner&quot; that will be useful to expand into
constituent sub-expressions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> built-in: <em>sum</em></p>
<p>o path expression ending in <em>.weight</em></p>
<p>▪ filter: <em>[record date &gt; date(&quot;2011-01-01 &quot;)]</em></p>
<p> name resolved in context: <em>credit history</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An expression in square brackets following a list expression filters the
list. <em>Credit history</em> is defined in the context as a relation, that is,
a list of similar contexts. Only the last item in the relation satisfies
the filter. The first item is too old. The path expression ending in
<em>.weight</em> selects the value of the <em>weight</em> entry from the context or
list of contexts satisfied by the filter. The <em>weight</em> of the last item
in the credit history is 150. This is the only item that satisfies the
filter, so the sum is 150 as well.</p>
<h3>Determine if credit history contain a bankruptcy event</h3>
<p>Some ch in credit history satisfies ch.event = &quot;bankruptcy&quot; false</p>
<p>The <em>some</em> expression determines if at least one element in a list or
relation satisfies a test. There are no bankruptcy events in the credit
history in the context.</p>
<h1>DMN Examples</h1>
<h2>Example 1: Originations</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In this clause we present an example of the use of <strong>DMN</strong> to model and
execute decision-making in a simple business process modeled in
<strong>BPMN</strong>, including decisions to be automated in decision services
called from the business process management system.</p>
<h3>The business process model</h3>
<p>Figure 11-1shows a simple process for loan originations, modeled in
<strong>BPMN 2.0</strong>. The process handles as application for a loan, obtaining
data from a credit bureau only if required for the case, and
automatically deciding whether the application should be accepted,
declined, or referred for human review. If referred, documents are
collected from the applicant and a credit officer adjudicates the case.
It consists of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Collect application data</strong> task collects data describing the
Requested product and the Applicant (e.g., through an on-line
application form).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Decide <strong>bureau Strategy</strong> task calls a decision service,
passing Requested product and Applicant data. The service returns
two decisions: Strategy and Bureau call type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>gateway</strong> uses the value of Strategy to route the case to
Decline application, Collect bureau data or Decide routing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Collect bureau data</strong> task collects data from a credit bureau
according to the Bureau call type decision, then the case is passed
to Decide routing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Decide routing</strong> task calls a decision service, passing
Requested product, Applicant data and Bureau data (if the Collect
bureau data task was not performed, the Bureau data are set to
null). The service returns a single decision: Routing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>gateway</strong> uses the value of Routing to route the case to Accept
application, Review application or Decline application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Collect documents</strong> task requests and uploads documents from
the applicant in support of their application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Review application</strong> task allows a credit officer to review
the case and decide whether it should be accepted or declined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>gateway</strong> uses the credit officer's Adjudication to route the
case to Accept application or Decline application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Accept application</strong> task informs the applicant that their
application is accepted and initiates the product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Decline application</strong> task informs the applicant that their
application is declined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in this example two decision points (automated as calls to
decision services) are represented in <strong>BPMN 2.0</strong> as business rule
tasks; the third decision point (which is human decision-making) is
represented as a user task.</p>

<h3>The decision requirements level</h3>
<p>The examples in this chapter were developed using a software that adds
icons to the elements. Although adding these icons is allowable by this
document it is not normative.</p>
<h4>Decision Requirements Diagrams</h4>
<p>Figure 11-2 shows a DRD of all the decision-making in this business
process. There are four sources of input data for the decision-making
(Requested product, Applicant data, Bureau data and Supporting
documents), and four decisions whose results are used in the business
process (Strategy, Bureau call type, Routing and Adjudication). Between
the two are intermediate decisions: evaluations of risk, affordability,
and eligibility. Notable features of this DRD include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It covers both automated and human decision-making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some decisions (e.g., Pre-bureau risk category) and input data
(e.g., Applicant data) are required by multiple decisions, i.e., the
information requirements network is not a tree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business knowledge models (see Affordability calculation) may be
invoked by multiple decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business knowledge models (see Credit contingency factor) may be
invoked by other business knowledge models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some decisions do not have associated business knowledge models.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowledge sources may provide authority for multiple decisions and/or
business knowledge models.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 11-2: DRD of all automated decision-making</strong></p>
<p>It might be considered more convenient to draw separate (but
overlapping) DRDs for the three decision points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Figure 11-3 shows the DRD of the decisions required for the Decide
bureau strategy decision point, i.e., the requirements subgraph of
the Strategy and Bureau call type decisions. These are decisions to
be automated through encapsulation in a decision service called at
this point, and therefore need their logic to be specified
completely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figure 11-4 shows the DRD for the Decide routing decision point,
i.e., the requirements subgraph of the Routing decision. These are
also decisions automated with a decision service, and therefore need
their logic to be specified completely. Note that some elements
appear in both Figure 11-3 and Figure 11-4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figure 11-5 shows the DRD for the Review application decision point,
i.e., the requirements subgraph of the Adjudication decision. This
is a human decision and has no associated specification of decision
logic, but the DRD indicates that the Credit officer takes into
account the results of the automated Routing decision along with the
case data, including the Supporting documents. (The requirements
subgraph of the Routing decision has been hidden in this DRD as
shown by the ellipsis (...) marker.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figure 11-6 shows an additional DRD for the Credit Risk Analytics
Knowledge Source i.e., the requirements linking this Knowledge
Source to other elements. DRDs can be used to provide views other
than for a specific decision.</p>

<h4>DRG Elements</h4>
<h5>Decisions</h5>
<p>The DRG depicted in these DRDs shows dependencies between the following
decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Strategy</strong> decision, requiring the Bureau call type and
Pre-bureau eligibility decisions, invokes the Strategy table shown
in Figure 11-9 (without that table being encapsulated in a business
knowledge model).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Bureau call type</strong> decision, requiring the Pre-bureau risk
category decision, invokes the Bureau call type table shown in
Figure 11-11.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Eligibility</strong> decision, requiring Applicant data and the
Pre-bureau risk category and Pre-bureau affordability decisions,
invokes the Eligibility rules shown in Figure 11-13.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Pre-bureau affordability</strong> decision, requiring Applicant data
and the Pre-bureau risk category and Required monthly installment
decisions, invokes the Affordability calculation boxed expression
shown in Figure 11-24, which in turn invokes the Credit contingency
factor table shown in Figure 11-25.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Pre-bureau risk category</strong> decision, requiring Applicant data
and the Application risk score decision, invokes the Pre-bureau risk
category table shown in Figure 11-15.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Application risk score</strong> decision, requiring Applicant data,
invokes the Application risk score model shown in Figure 11-17.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Routing</strong> decision, requiring Bureau data and the Post-bureau
affordability and Post-bureau risk category decisions, invokes the
Routing rules shown in Figure 11-19.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Post-bureau affordability</strong> decision, requiring Applicant data
and the Post-bureau risk score and Required monthly installment
decisions, invokes the Affordability calculation boxed expression
shown in Figure 11-24, which in turn invokes the Credit contingency
factor table shown in Figure 11-25.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Post-bureau risk category</strong> decision, requiring Applicant and
Bureau data and the Application risk score decision, invokes the
Post-bureau risk category table shown in Figure 11-21.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Required monthly installment</strong> decision, requiring Requested
product data, invokes the Installment calculation boxed expression
shown in Figure 11-27.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Adjudication</strong> decision, requiring Applicant data, Bureau
data, Supporting documents, and the Routing decision, has no
associated decision logic.</p>
</li>

<h4>Decision Services</h4>
<p>The two decision services required by the business process model are
defined against the decision model. The <strong>Bureau Strategy Decision
Service</strong>, called by the <strong>Decide bureau strategy</strong> task, has output

<h3>Executing the Decision Model</h3>
<p>In order to execute a decision model (in this case, by calling two
decision services), case data must be bound to the input data, much as
an invocation binds arguments to function parameters. The binding of
case data to input data, however, is not part of the decision model,
unlike the invocation that specifies how a decision's requirement inputs
bind to the parameters of that decision's required knowledge.</p>
<p>FEEL allows contexts and other expressions to be used to represent case
data (see also clauses 10.3.3.3.3 and 10.6.1). Input data is associated
with an item definition (clause 7.3.2) and the case data must have the
same type and other constraints specified by the item definition. Case
data must be mapped to the FEEL domain. For example, XML instance data
is mapped to the FEEL domain as described in clause 10.3.3.</p>
<p>For convenience, we will specify case data using boxed expressions
instead of XML. Figure 11-29, Figure 11-30, and Figure 11-31 show boxed
contexts defining case data for Applicant data, Requested product and
Bureau data.</p>

<h2>Example 2: Ranked Loan Products</h2>
<p>The second example considers eligibility for various mortgage loan
products based on the Borrower's income, assets, liabilities, and credit
score, and ranks them based on specified sort criteria. It illustrates
the wide variety of DMN expression types, including context, invocation,
relation, and function definition, as well as some of the newer FEEL
functions and operators, including import, service invocation, enhanced
iteration, generalized unary tests, and Java binding. The logic
represented here is just one of many different ways to model the
scenario.</p>
<p>The DRD for the decision model is shown in Figure 11-34.</p>
<p><img src="media/image143.jpg" alt="" />{width=&quot;6.772222222222222in&quot;
height=&quot;3.6638888888888888in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 11-34: DRD for Recommended Loan Products</strong></p>
<p>The input data elements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Credit Score</strong>, a number from 300 to 850 inclusive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Down Payment</strong>, a number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Property</strong>, a structure of type <em>tProperty</em> (Figure 11-35)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Borrower</strong>, a structure of type <em>tBorrower</em> (Figure 11-37), and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lender Ratings,</strong> a structure of type <em>tLenderRatings</em> (Figure</p>

</ul>
<p>The boxed expression format for the datatype definitions in Figure
11-35, Figure 11-37, and Figure 11-38 is non- normative. Figure 11-35,
for example, is a visualization of the XML representation of Figure

<p>In addition, the zero-input decision Loan Products, a structure of type
tLoanProducts, is a relation (Figure 11-39). Cells in a relation are
FEEL expressions but often contain literal values as a way to embed
static data tables inside a decision model. In this case it represents a
list of mortgage loan products available from various lenders,
specifying the best interest rate offered to lowest risk borrowers and
loan origination costs specified as &quot;points&quot;, a percentage of the loan
amount, and &quot;fees&quot;, a constant value.</p>

<p>The <strong>Recommended Loan Products</strong> model imports another decision model
<strong>Loan Info</strong>, with the DRD shown in Figure 11-41, defining a decision
service <strong>Loan Info Service</strong>. Imported models are assigned a
modeler-chosen prefix, here <em>Services</em>, to distinguish its namespace
from that of the importing model. In the importing DRD (Figure 11-34),
the imported service <strong>Services.Loan Info Service</strong> is depicted with the
non-normative lock icon, indicating that its logic may not be edited
within the importing model. The service parameters are the input data
shown in Figure 11-41: <strong>Credit Score, Property, Loan Product,</strong> and
<strong>Down Payment</strong>, with types identical to those defined in the importing
model.</p>
<p><strong>Services</strong>.<strong>Loan Info Service</strong> populates a row of the decision
<strong>Loan Info Table</strong>, a collection of type <strong>tLoanInfoRow</strong> (Figure
11-39), calculating the details of the selected loan product for the
given property value (purchase price) and down payment.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 11-43: Loan Data</strong></p>
<p>Within the service, <strong>Loan Data</strong> performs calculations used in the
presentation decision, <strong>Loan Info</strong>. It is modeled as a context with no
final result box, meaning every context entry creates a component of the
result. (The text &quot;Result&quot; in the final result box is a tool artifact
not in the spec, overwritten by a literal expression if the context has
a final result box value.) A few things to note about the logic shown in
Figure 11-43:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>FEEL arithmetic can create values with many digits following the
decimal point. The function decimal(x, 2) rounds value x to 2
decimal places.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Context entry Interest Rate Percent invokes the BKM <strong>Rate
Adjustment</strong> (Figure 11-44), a function of the borrower's <strong>Credit
Score</strong> and the loan-to-value ratio <strong>LTV</strong>. This increments the
Loan Product's interest rate by a small amount based on the loan
risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Credit Score</strong> values less than 620 are ineligible for a loan. In
that case, <strong>Rate Adjustment</strong> could return null, but then all
expressions using <strong>Rate Adjustment</strong> would also be null,
complicating the logic. To simplify the downstream logic, it is
better in this case to return a number, since ultimately the loan
will not be approved if the <strong>Credit Score</strong> is less than 620.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For loans with variable interest rate, the debt-to-income ratio uses
a <em>Qualifying Payment</em> amount based on an interest rate 2 percent
higher than the rate used in the initial <em>Monthly Payment</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Monthly Payment</em> and <em>Qualifying Payment</em> are modeled as boxed
invocations of the BKM <strong>payment</strong>, the amortization formula (Figure
11-45). The parameters of payment are the loan amount <em>p</em>, the
interest rate <em>r</em>, and the term in months, <em>n</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The decision <strong>Loan Info</strong> (Figure 11-46), the output of <strong>Services.Loan
Info</strong>, returns a row of <strong>Loan Info Table</strong>. It is also modeled as a
context with no final result box, meaning each context entry represents
a column of <strong>Loan Info Table.</strong></p>

is modeled as a literal expression using the FEEL <em>for. . in. .return</em>
operator. Here <em>x</em> is a range variable meaning one item in a list -- one
<strong>Loan Product</strong> in <strong>Loan Products</strong> -- producing an argument of the
function call.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 11-47: Loan Info Table</strong></p>
<p><strong>Loan Info Table</strong> now provides values for each <strong>Loan Product</strong> used
to determine whether the Borrower's income, assets, liabilities, and
credit score qualify for loa n approval.</p>
<p>At the heart of the logic for determining eligibility for a particular
loan is the BKM <strong>Min Credit Score</strong> (Figure 11-48), a decision table
that calculates the minimum credit score required based on three
parameters: <em>DTI</em>, the borrower's debt-toincome ratio; <em>LTV,</em> the
loan-to-value ratio; and <em>Reserves</em>, a measure of the Borrower's liquid
assets after closing in units of monthly <em>Housing Costs</em>. The table is
modeled as hit policy <em>Collect</em> with aggregation <em>Minimum</em>, meaning when
multiple rules match the lowest value output is returned. When <em>DTI</em> is
greater than 95%, the loan is automatically ineligible. In that case, no
rule matches and <strong>Min Credit Score</strong> returns the value null. Downstream
logic referencing this variable must account for the possibility of null
value.</p>

height=&quot;5.180555555555555in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 11-48: Min Credit Score</strong></p>
<p><strong>Min Credit Score</strong> is called by the BKM <strong>Eligibility,</strong> which in turn
calls the BKM <strong>Eligibility Parameters</strong> (Figure 11-49). <strong>Eligibility
Parameters</strong> calculates the two key parameters of <strong>Min Credit Score</strong>,
the debt-to-income ratio <em>DTI Pct</em>, and the liquid assets after closing,
called <em>Reserves</em>. Note that context entry <em>Housing Expense</em>, which sums
the loan payment, tax and insurance payments, and homeowner
association/condo fee, must account for the possibility that the latter
is left blank, i.e., null, in the input data <strong>Property</strong>, since adding
null to a number gives null. To prevent this, instead of the + operator
we use the <em>sum()</em> function on a list filtered by the condition <em>item !=
null.</em> We use this technique also on context entry <em>Income</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 11-49: Eligibility Parameters</strong></p>
<p>For legibility, the BKM <strong>Eligibility</strong> is shown in two pieces (Figure
11-50 and Figure 11-51). This BKM creates a row of type <em>tTableRow</em> for
the decision <strong>Eligibility Table</strong>. It is modeled as a context, where
the first four context entries (Figure 11-51) call BKMs to determine
values to populate the <em>Table Row</em> components.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Params</em> calls the BKM <strong>Eligibility Parameters</strong> for a given <strong>Loan
Product</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Required Credit Score</em> uses Params to call the BKM <strong>Min Credit
Score</strong>, returning the minimum credit score required by that <strong>Loan
Product</strong> for the Borrower to be eligible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Eligible</em> is a Boolean comparing the Borrower's credit score to
<strong>Min Credit Score.</strong> <em>Recommendation</em> uses the input data <strong>Lender
Ratings</strong> in combination with <strong>Eligible</strong> to return a
recommendation value for the <strong>Loan Product</strong>. <em>Recommendation</em>
illustrates an alternative decision table syntax introduced in DMN
1.2 called generalized unary test. With generalized unary tests, a
decision table input entry may be any FEEL expression, substituting
? for the input expression. For example, in the first column of this
decision table the rules filter the <strong>Lender Ratings</strong> table for an
item with <em>Lender Name</em> matching that of the <strong>Loan Product</strong> and
<em>Customer Rating</em> in a specified range, returning true if that
filter returns any values.</p>

<p>The decision <strong>Eligibility Table</strong> (Figure 11-52) uses an alternative
form of the <em>for. .in..return</em> operator to iterate over an index rather
than iterate over list item values. This alterative format allows the
returned expression to involve corresponding items in multiple lists, in
this case <strong>Loan Products</strong> and <strong>Loan Info Table</strong>.</p>

<p>The first context entry <em>precedes</em> is a function definition used by
the FEEL <em>sort()</em> function. The second parameter of <em>sort()</em>, called
the <em>precedes function</em>, is a Boolean function with two arguments
representing list items. It returns true if the first argument
precedes the second in the sorted list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The context entry <em>Sorted Table</em> performs the sort. With simple sort
criteria, the precedes function is typically defined inline as an
anonymous function using the keyword <em>function</em>, as in</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>sort(myTable, function(x, y) x.Amount &lt; y.Amount)</p>
<p>which sorts the rows of <em>myTable</em> in ascending order of the column
<em>Amount</em>. However, in <strong>Recommended Loan Products</strong> we instead use a
named precedes function, the context entry <em>precedes</em>. In that case,
the name of the function provides the second argument of <em>sort().</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The final result box iterates a call to the BKM <strong>Format Row</strong>,
which executes a static Java method to format number values in
<em>Sorted Table</em> as strings with a currency symbol and two digits
following the decimal point.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Format Row</strong> (Figure 11-55) operates on a single row of <em>Sorted
Table</em>. It is modeled as a context.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first context entry <em>string format</em> is a Java function
definition, indicated by the code J. DMN specifies such a function
definition as a context with two context entries, <em>class,</em> and
<em>method signature</em>. This example applies a mask string to a number,
returning a formatted number string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second context entry <em>formatted row</em> generates a row of
<strong>Recommended Loan Products</strong> in final presentation format, calling

<h1>Exchange Formats</h1>
<h2>Interchanging Incomplete Models</h2>
<p>It is common for <strong>DMN</strong> models to be interchanged before they are
complete. This occurs frequently when doing iterative modeling, where
one user (such as a knowledge source expert or business user) first
defines a high-level model and then passes it on to another person to
complete or refine the model.</p>
<p>Such &quot;incomplete&quot; models are ones in which not all of the mandatory
model attributes have been filled in yet or the cardinality of the lower
bound of attributes and associations has not been satisfied.</p>
<p>XMI allows for the interchange of such incomplete models. In <strong>DMN</strong>, we
extend this capability to interchange of XML files based on the <strong>DMN</strong>
XML-Schema. In such XML files, implementers are expected to support this
interchange by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Disregarding missing attributes that are marked as &quot;required&quot; in
the <strong>DMN</strong> XML-Schema.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing the lower bound of elements with &quot;minOccurs&quot; greater than
0.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Machine Readable Files</h2>
<p>All machine-readable files, including XSD, XMI and XML files, can be
found in OMG Document dtc/1 5-11-12, which is a flat zip file.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For the <strong>DMN</strong> XMI Model, the main file is DMN.xmi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the <strong>DMN</strong> XSD Interchange (supporting Conformance Levels 1, 2
and 3), the main file is DMN.xsd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A serialization of the example in clause 11 is provided in
ch11example.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>XSD</h2>
<h3>Document Structure</h3>
<p>A domain-specific set of model elements is interchanged in one or more
<strong>DMN</strong> files. The root element of each file SHALL be &lt;DMN**:**
Definitions&gt;. The set of files SHALL be self-contained, i.e., all
definitions that are used in a file SHALL be imported directly or
indirectly using the &lt;DMN**:** Import&gt; element.</p>
<p>Each file SHALL declare a &quot;name space&quot; that MAY differ between multiple
files of one model.</p>
<p><strong>DMN</strong> files MAY import non-<strong>DMN</strong> files (such as XSDs and PMMLs) if
the contained elements use external definitions.</p>
<h3>References within the DMN XSD</h3>
<p>Many <strong>DMN</strong> elements that may need to be referenced contain IDs and
within the <strong>BPMN</strong> XSD, references to elements are expressed via these
IDs. The XSD IDREF type is the traditional mechanism for referencing by
IDs, however it can only reference an element within the same file.
<strong>DMN</strong> elements of type DMNElementReference support referencing by ID,
across files, by utilizing an href attribute whose value must be a valid
URI reference [RFC 3986] where the path components may be absolute or
relative, the reference has no query component, and the fragment
consists of the value of the id of the referenced <strong>DMN</strong> element.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following Decision:</p>
<p>&lt;decision name=&quot;Pre-Bureau Risk Category&quot;
id=&quot;prebureauriskDec01&quot;&gt;...&lt;/decision&gt;</p>
<p>When this Decision is referenced, e.g., by an InformationRequirement in
a Decision that is defined in another file, the reference could take the
following form:</p>
<p>&lt;requiredDecision href=&quot;http: //<a href="http://www.example.org/Definitions01">www. example.
org/Definitions01</a> .
xml#prebureauriskDec01&quot;/&gt;where &quot;http: //<a href="http://www.example.org/Definitions01">www. example.
org/Definitions01</a> . xml&quot; is an
URI reference to the XML document in which the &quot;PreBureau Risk Category&quot;
Decision is defined (e.g., the value of the locationURI attribute in the
corresponding Import element), and &quot;prebureauriskDec01&quot; is the value of
the id attribute for the Decision.</p>
<p>If the path component in the URI reference is relative, the base URI
against which the relative reference is applied is determined as
specified in [RFC 3986]. According to that specification, &quot;<em>if no base
URI is embedded and the representation is not encapsulated within some
other entity, then, if a URI was used to retrieve the representation,
that URI shall be considered the base URI</em>&quot; ([RFC 3986], section
5.1.3). That is, if the reference is not in the scope of an xml:base
attribute [XBASE], a value of the href attribute that contains only a
fragment, and no path component references a <strong>DMN</strong> element that is
defined in the same instance of XML file as the referencing element. In
the example below, assuming that the requiredDecision element is not in
the scope of an xml:base attribute, the <strong>DMN</strong> element whose id is
&quot;prebureauriskDec01&quot; must be defined in the same XML document:</p>
<p>&lt;requiredDecision href=&quot;#prebureauriskDec01&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>Notice that the <strong>BPMN</strong> processes and tasks that use a decision are
referenced using the href attribute as well:</p>
<p>indeed, it is compatible with the system to reference external Process
and Task instances in <strong>BPMN 2.0</strong> Definitions, which is also based on
IDs.</p>
<p>Attribute typeRef references ItemDefinitions and built-in types by name
not ID. In order to support imported types, typeRef uses the
namespace-qualified name syntax [qualifer].[local-name], where
qualifier is specified by the name attribute of the Import element for
the imported type. If the referenced type is not imported, the prefix
SHALL be omitted.</p>
<h1>DMN Diagram Interchange (DMN DI)</h1>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>This chapter specifies the meta-model and schema for <strong>DMN</strong> Diagram
Interchange (<strong>DMN DI</strong>). The <strong>DMN DI</strong> is meant to facilitate the
interchange of <strong>DMN</strong> diagrams between tools rather than being used for
internal diagram representation by the tools. The simplest interchange
approach to ensure the unambiguous rendering of a <strong>DMN</strong> diagram was
chosen for <strong>DMN DI</strong>. As such, <strong>DMN DI</strong> does not aim to preserve or
interchange any &quot;tool smarts&quot; between the source and target tools (e.g.,
layout smarts, efficient styling, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>DMN DI</strong> does not ascertain that the <strong>DMN</strong> diagram is syntactically
or semantically correct.</p>
<p>This version of DMN DI focuses on the interchange of Decision
Requirements Diagrams (DRDs). Diagram Interchange for boxed expressions
and decision tables might be added in future versions.</p>
<h2>Diagram Definition and Interchange</h2>
<p>The <strong>DMN DI</strong> meta-model, similar to the DMN abstract syntax
meta-model, is defined as a MOF-based meta-model. As such, its instances
can be serialized and interchanged using XMI. DMN DI is also defined by
an XML schema. Thus, its instances can also be serialized and
interchanged using XML.</p>
<p>Both DMN DI meta-model and schema are harmonized with the OMG Diagram
Definition (DD) standard version 1.1. The referenced DD contains two
main parts: the Diagram Commons (DC) and the Diagram Interchange (DI).
The DC defines common types like bounds and points, while the DI
provides a framework for defining domain-specific diagram models. As a
domain-specific DI, DMN DI defines a few new meta-model classes that
derive from the abstract classes from DI.</p>
<p>The focus of DMN DI is the interchange of laid out shapes and edges that
constitute a <strong>DMN</strong> diagram. Each shape and edge reference a particular
<strong>DMN</strong> model element. The referenced <strong>DMN</strong> model elements are all
part of the actual <strong>DMN</strong> model. As such, DMN DI is meant to only
contain information that is neither present nor derivable, from the
<strong>DMN</strong> model whenever possible. Simply put, to render a <strong>DMN</strong> diagram
both the DMN DI instance(s) and the referenced <strong>DMN</strong> model are
REQUIRED.</p>
<p>From the DMN DI perspective, a DMN diagram is a particular snapshot of a
<strong>DMN</strong> model at a certain point in time. Multiple <strong>DMN</strong> diagrams can
be exchanged referencing model elements from the same <strong>DMN</strong> model.
Each diagram may provide an incomplete or partial depiction of the
content of the <strong>DMN</strong> model. As described in clause 12, a <strong>DMN</strong> model
package consists of one or more files. Each file may contain any number
of <strong>DMN</strong> diagrams. The exporting tool is free to decide how many
diagrams are exported and the importing tool is free to decide if and
how to present the contained diagrams to the user.</p>
<h2>How to read this chapter</h2>
<p>Clause 13.4 describes in detail the meta-model used to keep the layout
and the look of <strong>DMN</strong> Diagrams. Clause 13.5 presents in tables a
library of the <strong>DMN</strong> element depictions and an unambiguous resolution
between a referenced <strong>DMN</strong> model element and its depiction.</p>
<h2>DMN Diagram Interchange Meta-Model</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The DMN DI is an instance of the OMG DI meta-model. The basic concept of
DMN DI, as with DI in general, is that serializing a diagram
[DMNDiagram] for interchange requires the specification of a
collection of shapes [DMNShape] and edges [DMNEdge].</p>
<p>The DMN DI classes only define the visual properties used for depiction.
All other properties that are REQUIRED for the unambiguous depiction of
the <strong>DMN</strong> element are derived from the referenced <strong>DMN</strong> element
[dmnElementRef].</p>
<p><strong>DMN</strong> diagrams may be an incomplete or partial depiction of the
content of the <strong>DMN</strong> model. Some <strong>DMN</strong> elements from a <strong>DMN</strong> model
may not be present in any of the diagram instances being interchanged.</p>
<p>DMN DI does not directly provide for any containment concept. The
DMNDiagram is an ordered collection of mixed DMNShape(s) and DMNEdge(s).
The order of the DMNShape(s) and DMNEdge(s) inside a DMNDiagram
determines their Z-order (i.e., what is in front of what). DMNShape(s)
and DMNEdge(s) that are meant to be depicted &quot;on top&quot; of other
DMNShape(s) and DMNEdge(s) MUST appear after them in the DMNDiagram.
Thus, the exporting tool MUST order all DMNShape(s) and DMNEdge(s) such
that the desired depiction can be rendered.Measurement UnitAs per OMG
DD, all coordinates and lengths defined by DMN DI are assumed to be in
user units, except when specified otherwise. A user unit is a value in
the user coordinate system, which initially (before any transformation
is applied) aligns with the device's coordinate system (for example, a
pixel grid of a display). A user unit, therefore, represents a logical
rather than physical measurement unit. Since some applications might
specify a physical dimension for a diagram as well (mainly for printing
purposes), a mapping from a user unit to a physical unit can be
specified as a diagram's resolution. Inch is chosen in this
specification to avoid variability, but tools can easily convert from/to
other preferred physical units. Resolution specifies how many user units
fit within one physical unit (for example, a resolution of 300 specifies
that 300 user units fit within 1 inch on the device).</p>

<p><strong>Figure 13-2: DMNDiagram</strong></p>
<p>The class DMNDiagram specializes DI::Diagram. It is a kind of Diagram
that represents a depiction of all or part of a <strong>DMN</strong> model.</p>
<p>DMNDiagram is the container of DMNDiagramElement (DMNShape(s) and
DMNEdge(s)). DMNDiagram cannot include other DMNDiagram.</p>
<p>A DMNDiagram can define a DMNStyle locally and/or it can refer to a
shared one defined in the DMNDI. Properties defined in the local style
overrides the one in the referenced shared style. That combined style
(shared and local) is the default style for all the DMNDiagramElement
contained in this DMNDiagram.</p>
<p>The DMNDiagram class represents a two-dimensional surface with an origin
of (0, 0) at the top left corner. This means that the x and y axes have
increasing coordinates to the right and bottom. Only positive
coordinates are allowed for diagram elements that are nested in a
DMNDiagram.</p>
<p>The DMNDiagram has the following attributes.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 13-3: DMNDiagramElement</strong></p>
<p>The DMNDiagramElement class is contained by the DMNDiagram and is the
base class for DMNShape and DMNEdge.</p>
<p>DMNDiagramElement inherits its styling from its parent DMNDiagram. In
addition, it can refer to one of the shared DMNStyle defined in the
DMNDI and/or it can define a local style. See clause 13.4.9 for more
details on styling.</p>
<p>DMNDiagramElement MAY also contain a DMNLabel when it has a visible text
label. If no DMNLabel is defined, the DMNDiagramElement should be
depicted without a label.</p>
<p>DMNDiagramElement has the following attributes:</p>

<p><strong>Figure 13-4: DMNShape</strong></p>
<p>The DMNShape class specializes DI::Shape and DMNDiagramElement. It is a
kind of Shape that depicts a DMNElement from the DMN model.</p>
<p>DMNShape represents a Decision, a Business Knowledge Model, an Input
Data element, a Knowledge Source, a Decision Service or a Text
Annotation that is depicted on the diagram.</p>
<p>DMNShape has three additional properties (isListedInputData, isCollapsed
and decisionServiceDividerLine) that are used to further specify the
appearance of some shapes that cannot be deduced from the DMN model.</p>
<p>DMNShape extends DI::Shape and DMNDiagramElement and has the following
attributes:</p>

<p><strong>Figure 13-5: DMNEdge</strong></p>
<p>The DMNEdge class specializes DI::Edge and DMNDiagramElement. It is a
kind of Edge that can depict a relationship between two <strong>DMN</strong> model
elements.</p>
<p>DMNEdge are used to depict Requirements or Associations in the <strong>DMN</strong>
model. Since DMNDiagramElement might be depicted more than once,
sourceElement and targetElement attributes allow to determine to which
depiction a</p>
<p>DMNEdge is connected. When DMNEdge has a source, its sourceModelElement
MUST refer to the</p>
<p>DMNDiagramElement it starts from. That DMNDiagramElement MUST resolved
to the DMNElement that is the actual source of the Requirement or
Association. For Requirement, this is the required DMNElement. When it
has a target, its targetModelElement MUST refer to the DMNDiagramElement
where it ends. That</p>
<p>DMNDiagramElement MUST resolved to the DMNElement that is the actual
target of the Requirement or Association. For Requirement, this is the
DMNElement holding it.</p>
<p>DMNEdge extends DI::Edge and has the following properties:</p>

<p><strong>Figure 13-6: DMNLabel</strong></p>
<p>DMNLabel represents the depiction of some textual information about a
DMN element.</p>
<p>A DMN label is not a top-level element but is always nested inside
either a DMNShape or a DMNEdge. It does not have its own reference to a
<strong>DMN</strong> element but rather inherits that reference from its parent
DMNShape or DMNEdge. The textual information depicted by the label is
derived from the name attribute of the referenced DMNElement.</p>
<p>DMNLabel extends DI::Shape and has the following properties:</p>
<p>+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| &gt; <strong>Attribute</strong>      | &gt; <strong>Description</strong>                             |

| &gt; <strong>bounds</strong>: Bounds | The bounds of the DMNLabel. When not          |
| &gt; [0..1]           | specified, the label is positioned at its     |
|                      | default position as determined in clause 13.5 |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| &gt; <strong>text</strong>:          | An optional pretty printed text that MUST be  |
| &gt; String[0..1]     | displayed instead of the DMNElement's name if |

<h3>DMNStyle [Class]</h3>
<p><img src="media/image176.png" alt="" />{width=&quot;4.895833333333333in&quot; height=&quot;3.25in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 13-7: DMNStyle</strong></p>
<p>DMNStyle specializes DC::Style. It is a kind of Style that provides
appearance options for a</p>
<p>DMNDiagramElement.</p>
<p>DMNStyle is used to keep some non-normative visual attributes such as
colors and font. DMN doesn't give any semantic to color and font
styling, but tools can decide to use them and interchange them.</p>
<p>DMNDiagramElement style is calculated by percolating up DMNStyle
attributes defined at a different level of the hierarchy. Each attribute
is considered independently (meaning that a DMNStyle attribute can be
individually overloaded). The precedence rules are as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The DMNStyle defined by the localStyle attribute of the
DMNDiagramElement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The DMNStyle referenced by the sharedStyle attribute of the
DMNDiagramElement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The DMNStyle defined by the localStyle attribute of the parent
DMNDiagram</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The DMNStyle referenced by the sharedStyle attribute of the parent
DMNDiagram</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The default attribute value defined in Table 100 (DMNStyle attributes).</p>
<p>For example, let's say we have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DMNDiagramElement has a local DMNStyle that specifies the fillColor
and strokeColor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its parent DMNDiagram defines a local DMNStyle that specifies the
fillColor and fontColor</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the resulting DMNDiagramElement should use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The fillColor and strokeColor defined at the DMNDiagramElement level
(as they are defined locally).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fontColor defined at the DMNDiagram level (as the fillColor was
overloaded locally).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All other DMNStyle attributes would have their default values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DMNStyle extends DC::Style and has the following properties:</p>

<h2>Notation Depiction Library and Abstract Element Resolutions</h2>
<p>As a notation, <strong>DMN</strong> specifies the depiction for each of the <strong>DMN</strong>
elements.</p>
<p>Serializing a <strong>DMN</strong> diagram for interchange requires the specification
of a collection of DMNShape(s) (see 13.4.6) and DMNEdge(s) (see 13.4.7)
in the DMNDiagram (see 13.4.4). The DMNShape(s) and DMNEdge(s)
attributes must be populated in such a way as to allow the unambiguous
rendering of the DMN diagram by the receiving party. More specifically,
the DMNShape(s) and DMNEdge(s) MUST reference <strong>DMN</strong> model elements. If
no DMNElement is referenced or if the reference is invalid, it is
expected that this shape or edge should not be depicted.</p>
<p>When rendering a <strong>DMN</strong> diagram, the correct depiction of a DMNShape or
DMNEdge depends mainly on the referenced <strong>DMN</strong> model element and its
particular attributes and/or references. The purpose of this clause is
to: provide a library of the <strong>DMN</strong> element depictions, and to provide
an unambiguous resolution between the referenced <strong>DMN</strong> model element
[DMNElement] and their depiction. Depiction resolution tables are
provided below for both DMNShape (see 13.5.2) and DMNEdge (see 13.5.3).</p>
<h3>Labels</h3>
<p>Both DMNShape and DMNEdge may have labels (its name attribute) placed on
the shape/edge, or above or below the shape/edge, in any direction or
location, depending on the preference of the modeler or modeling tool
vendor.</p>
<p>Labels are optional for DMNShape and DMNEdge. When there is a label, the
position of the label is specified by the bounds of the DMNLabel of the
DMNShape or DMNEdge. Simply put, label visibility is defined by the
presence of the DMNLabel element.</p>
<p>The bounds of the DMNLabel are optional and always relative to the
containing DMNDiagram's origin point. The depiction resolution tables
provided below exemplify default label positions if no bounds are
provided for the DMNLabel (for DMNShape kinds (see 13.5.2) and DMNEdge
kinds (see 13.5.3)).</p>
<p>When the DMNLabel is contained in a DMNShape, the text to display is the
name of the DMNElement.</p>
<h3>DMNShape Resolution</h3>
<p>DMNShape can be used to represent a Decision, a Business Knowledge
Model, an Input Data element, a Knowledge Source, a Text Annotation, a
Group, and a Decision Service.</p>
<h4>Decision</h4>
<p>A Decision is represented in a DRD as a rectangle, normally drawn with
solid lines. If the Listed Input Data option is exercised, all the
Decisions requirements for Input Data shall be listed beneath the
Decisions label and separated from it by a horizontal line. The listed
Input Data names shall be clearly inside the shape of the DRD element.</p>

(informative)</p>
<pre><code>1.  []{#_Toc108786368 .anchor}Goals of BPMN and DMN
</code></pre>
<p>The OMG Business Process Model and Notation Standard provides a standard
notation for describing business processes as orchestrations of tasks.
The success of <strong>BPMN</strong> has provided a major motivation for <strong>DMN,</strong> and
business decisions described using <strong>DMN</strong> are expected to be commonly
deployed in business processes described using <strong>BPMN</strong>.</p>
<p>All statements pertaining to <strong>BPMN</strong> below are from the OMG document
reference 11-01-03 unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p><strong>BPMN</strong>'s goals are stated in the specification and provide easy
comparisons to <strong>DMN</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Goal 1: &quot;<em>The primary goal of</em> <strong>BPMN</strong> <em>is to provide a notation
that is readily understandable by all business users, from the
business analysts that create the initial drafts of the processes,
to the technical developers responsible for implementing the
technology that will perform those processes, and finally, to the
businesspeople who will manage and monitor those processes. Thus,</em>
<strong>BPMN</strong> <em>creates a standardized bridge for the gap between the
business process design and process implementation.</em>&quot;. <strong>DMN</strong> users
will also be business analysts (designing decisions) and then
business users (populating decision models such as decision tables).
Technical developers may be responsible for mapping business terms
to appropriate data technologies. Therefore, <strong>DMN</strong> can also be
said to bridge the decision design by a business analyst, and the
decision implementation, typically using some decision execution
technology,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goal 2: <em>&quot;... To ensure that XML languages designed for the
execution of business processes, such as WSBPEL (Web Services
Business Process Execution Language), can be visualized with a
businessoriented notation.&quot;</em> It is not a stated goal of <strong>DMN</strong> to
be able to visualize other XML languages (such as W3C RIF or OMG
PRR); indeed, it is expected that <strong>DMN</strong> would provide the MDA
specification layer for such languages. It does not preclude however
the use of <strong>DMN</strong> (such as decision tables) to represent executable
forms (such as production rules).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goal 3: <em>&quot;The intent of</em> <strong>BPMN</strong> <em>is to standardize a business
process model and notation in the face of many different modeling
notations and viewpoints. In doing so,</em> <strong>BPMN</strong> <em>will provide a
simple means of communicating process information to other business
users, process implementers, customers, and suppliers.&quot;</em> Similarly,
the intent of <strong>DMN</strong> is to standardize the decision model and
notation across the many different implementations of broadly
semantically similar models. In so doing, <strong>DMN</strong> will also
facilitate the communication of decision information across business
communities and tools.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>A.2 BPMN Tasks and DMN Decisions  {#a.2-bpmn-tasks-and-dmn-decisions .unnumbered}</h2>
<p>Most <strong>BPMN</strong> diagrams contain some tasks which involve decision-making
which can be modeled in <strong>DMN</strong>. These tasks take input data acquired or
generated earlier in the process and produce decision outputs which are
used later in the process. Decision outputs may be used in two principal
ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They may be consumed in another process task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They may influence the choice of sequence flows out of a gateway.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the latter case, decisions are used to determine which subprocesses
or tasks are to be executed (in the process sense). As such, <strong>DMN</strong>
complements <strong>BPMN</strong> as decision modeling complements process modeling
(in the sense of defining orchestrations or work tasks).</p>
<p>For example, Figure A.1 shows an example^1^ of a <strong>BPMN</strong>-defined
process.</p>
<p><img src="media/image194.jpg" alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;6.749660979877516in&quot;
height=&quot;3.502736220472441in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure A.1: Decision-making in BPMN</strong></p>
<p>Analyzing this we see:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A task whose title starts with &quot;Decide...&quot; which makes a decision
on (whether to use) normal post or special shipment, and which
precedes an exclusive gateway using that decision result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A task whose title starts with &quot;Check...&quot; which makes a decision on
whether extra insurance is necessary, which precedes an inclusive
gateway for which an additional process path may be executed based
on the decision result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A task whose title starts with &quot;Assign...&quot; which implies a decision
to select a carrier based on some selection criteria. The previous
task is effectively collecting data for this decision. In an
automated system this would probably be a subprocess embedding a
decision and some other activities (such as &quot;prepare paperwork&quot;).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From this example we can see that even a simple business process in
<strong>BPMN</strong> may have several decision-making tasks.</p>
<h2>A.3 Types of BPMN Tasks relevant to DMN  {#a.3-types-of-bpmn-tasks-relevant-to-dmn .unnumbered}</h2>
<p><strong>BPMN</strong> defines^2^ different types of tasks that can be considered for
decision-making roles. The relevant tasks are as shown in Table 111:</p>
<p>1.Shipment Process in a Hardware Retailer example, Ch5.1, BPMN 2.0 By
Example, June 2010, OMG reference 10-06-02</p>
<p>2.See ch 10.2.3 in the BPMN Specification.</p>
<p><strong>Table 111: BPMN tasks relevant to DMN</strong></p>
<p><img src="media/image195.jpg" alt="A picture containing table Description automatically generated" />{width=&quot;6.40625in&quot;
height=&quot;4.606944444444444in&quot;}</p>
<p>A future version of <strong>BPMN</strong> may choose to clarify and extend the
definitions of task to better match decision modeling requirements and
<strong>DMN</strong> -- to wit, to define a <strong>BPMN</strong> Decision Task as some task used
to make a decision modeled with <strong>DMN</strong>. In the meantime, the Business
Rule Task is the most natural way to express this functionality.
However, as noted in clauses 5.2.2 and 6.3.6, a Decision in <strong>DMN</strong> can
be associated with any Task, allowing for flexibility in implementation.</p>
<h2>A.4 Process gateways and Decisions  {#a.4-process-gateways-and-decisions .unnumbered}</h2>
<p>Process gateways can be considered of 2 types:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A gateway that determines a process route or routes based on
existing data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A gateway that determines a process route or routes based on the
outcome of one or more decisions that are determined by some
previous task within the process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the latter case, a Decision Task (task used to make a decision using
<strong>DMN</strong>) may need an extended notation to clarify the relationship of
the decision task to the gateway(s) that use it.</p>
<h2>A.5 Linking BPMN and DMN Models  {#a.5-linking-bpmn-and-dmn-models .unnumbered}</h2>
<p><strong>DMN</strong> offers two approaches to linking business process models in
<strong>BPMN</strong> with decision models: one normative and the other
non-normative:</p>
<h3>a) Associating Decisions with Tasks and Processes  {#a-associating-decisions-with-tasks-and-processes .unnumbered}</h3>
<p>As described in clause 6.3.6, in <strong>DMN</strong>, the process context for an
instance of Decision is defined by its association with any number of
usingProcesses, which are instances of Process as defined in OMG <strong>BPMN
2</strong>, and any number of usingTasks, which are instances of Task as
defined in OMG <strong>BPMN 2</strong>. Each decision may therefore be associated
with one or more business processes (to indicate that the decision is
taken during those processes), and/or with one or more specific tasks
(to indicate that the tasks involve making the decision). An
implementation SHALL allow these associations to be defined for each
decision.</p>
<p>An implementation MAY perform validation over the two (<strong>BPMN</strong> and
<strong>DMN</strong>) models, to check, for example, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Decision is not associated with Tasks that are part of Processes
not also associated with the Decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Decision is not associated with Tasks that are not part of any
Process associated with the Decision.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During development it may be appropriate to associate a Decision only
with a Process, but inconsistency between Task and Process associations
is not allowed.</p>
<p>Note that this approach allows the relationships between business
process models and decision models to be defined and validated but does
not of itself permit the decisions modeled in <strong>DMN</strong> to be executed
automatically by processes modeled in <strong>BPMN</strong>.</p>
<h3>b) Decision Services  {#b-decision-services .unnumbered}</h3>
<p>One approach to decision automation is described non-normatively in
Annex A: the encapsulation of <strong>DMN</strong> Decisions in a &quot;decision service&quot;
called from a <strong>BPMN</strong> Task (e.g., a Service Task or Business Rule Task,
as discussed in Annex A..3 above). The usingProcesses and usingTasks
properties allow definition and validation of associations between
<strong>BPMN</strong> and <strong>DMN</strong>; the definition of decision services then provides
a detailed specification of the required interface.</p>
